            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THis Book is a Traveller, as the Prince for whoſe ſake the Author compoſed it. It was born in <hi>Germany;</hi> from whence it paſſed into <hi>France,</hi> where it was kindly received, and Naturalized: Now being arrived in <hi>England,</hi> and finding ſome private welcome, it deſires at leaſt to be a Denizen here. What it contains, will brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear in the following Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of the Dialogues; But why I undertook to render it into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, beſides the entertainment of ſome of my vacant hours, <hi>I</hi> have little to juſtify my ſelf, but the zeal which every Chriſtian ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:96329:4"/>have at this time, to arm himſelf with the beſt weapons he hath, to oppoſe the Barbarous proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a proud and implacable Enemy. My Magazin and Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery extends to no more then Pen and ink; with which <hi>I</hi> vainly fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied <hi>I</hi> might ſeem to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; As when the induſtrious and judicious Mr. <hi>Dugdale Norroy</hi> King of Arms, perceiving that ſlow-paced ruine, or (which was worſe) haſty impiety had ſhaken moſt of the ſacred ſtructures in this Kingdom, and threatened all the reſt, thought it a provident (but we may juſtly call it a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and meritorious) work, to ſave them in <hi>Effigie,</hi> and keep up both their memory and models in exact braſs Cuts, adding his own profound Reſearches and elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb facs="tcp:96329:4"/>diſcourſes, which are indeed — <hi>monumentum aere perennius;</hi> ſo (though the compariſon fall infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ſhort in moſt things) there being now too much reaſon to apprehend, that the dreadful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation of the Mahometans (without almoſt a miracle) is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to overwhelm the State, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, Laws and Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> nay, <hi>to take away both their place and Nation, I</hi> conceived it both pious and ſeaſonable, as far as lay in me, to reſcue that noble Countrey from oblivion, by publiſhing this ſmall Treatiſe in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> wherein the marks and footſteps of that Empire may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main amongſt us. Thou wilt find it to be a Tranſlation (if the Title-page had not confeſt it) with that uſual &amp; unavoidable imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb facs="tcp:96329:5"/>that notions paſſing out of one Language into another do, as it happens in the transfuſion of liquors into divers veſſels, carry much dregs along with them, and alwayes taſte of the Cask. <hi>I</hi> may perchance be blamed with reaſon enough for following the word too cloſe, yet <hi>I</hi> think <hi>I</hi> may ſafely ſay in general <hi>I</hi> have not gone far from the ſenſe. But certainly if <hi>I</hi> had put it into finer Language and more elegant expreſſions, the work had been ſo far mine, and ſo much worſe.

            <head>A Summary of the Dialogues.</head>
            <p>THis Treatiſe contains ten Dialogues between a Prince and his Governor, who teaches him all that there is conſiderable in the Empire: For this Book comprehends in brief all that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of Law and the Interpreters of the Golden Bull have written thereupon; as may be ſeen in the reading of it.</p>
            <div n="1" type="dialogue">
               <head>I. Dialogue.</head>
               <p>This Dialogue ſerves for an Introduction to the reſt, and the Governor having ſhown his young Prince, that he ſhould learn to be a good Chriſtian, before he learn to be a good Prince; makes him underſtand, that it is neceſſary for him to go out of his Fathers Court, and travel through Forein Countries, as a means to become ſuch. Here it is diſcourſed at large of certain Travellers that learn nothing but the worſt faſhions and cuſtoms of other Nations. Then he ſhowes the advantage of Travelling with judgement, and in company of ſuch as know what is requiſite to be obſerved in every part of Europe. After that, he makes it appear, that it is eaſy to become a wiſe Counſellor and an able Souldier by Travelling; wherein a
<pb facs="tcp:96329:6"/>man learns to know the humour of people, and the Languages. Hereupon he ſpeaks of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of Languages, the cauſe thereof, and other curious notions. Laſtly he maketh his Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Prince underſtand that he ought to know the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Tongues; and that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out buſying himſelf upon ſciences that have more vanity then ſolidity, he ſhould learn the art of Governing well, and conſequently the Eſtate of the Empire, which contains almoſt all that a Prince ought to know.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="dialogue">
               <head>II. Dialogue.</head>
               <p>This Dialogue containes the Eſtate of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in general; and therein is ſhown, that the Emperor is a Monarch, though he have not an abſolute power to do all that he pleaſes, foraſmuch as the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> acknowledge that all their dignity is communicated to them by and from him. He can create Kings, Arch Dukes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but cannot confer Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, and why.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this Dialogue the Author ſayes, that his Book ſhall treat of the Head and principal Members of the Empire; of their power &amp; authority; of the Origine, progreſs, and alliances of the illuſtrious Houſes; of the rank and place they hold in the Aſſemblies; of the Branches of every Family; of the cauſes of love, hatred, and
<pb facs="tcp:96329:6"/>jealouſie amongſt them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After that, he proves that the Eſtate of the Empire is Monarchical, and confuting the contrary opinions, he eſtabliſhes his own. And becauſe the Emperor hath not right to confer Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the reaſon thereof; and makes it clear, that notwithſtanding all that, he is the firſt Monarch in the world. And foraſmuch as he is made ſo by Election, the Author ſpeaks of the Electors, their beginning, their power, their order, and their number; and ſhowing what neceſſity there was to increaſe the laſt, he brings the reaſons which the Ancients had to raiſe to that dignity three Eccleſiaſtical, and four Secular Princes, who have power to create and depoſe the Emperor, and the King of the Romans. Then he ſpeaks of the Ceremonies uſed at their Coronation, and of the power both of the one and the other.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="dialogue">
               <head>III. Dialogue.</head>
               <p>In this Dialogue he ſpeaks of the Estates of the Empire; and having ſhown that thoſe which are ſo, have many rights of Regality, he paſſes to the conſideration of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers its original, how long it hath born the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Crown, into how many Branches it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, how it came to be ſo powerful, and what are its priviledges. After that, he diſcourſes of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine, Saxon,</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Houſes; and ſayes all that the curious can deſire to know about them.</p>
            </div>

               <pb facs="tcp:96329:7"/>
               <head>IV. V. Dialogues.</head>
               <p>In theſe two Dialogues he treats of all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Princes of the Empire, and of every Houſe in particular, aſſuring the curious they ſhall there find wherewithal to ſatisfie themſelves in their ſearch after the antiquity, deſcendancies, rights, rank, titles, alliances, and Branches of the Houſes of <hi>Brunſwick, Meklebourg, Wirtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, Heſſe, Baden, Holſtein, Saxon-Lawem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, Anhalt, Hohenzolleren, Aremberg, Henneberg,</hi> and <hi>Eaſt Friſeland;</hi> in like manner as they ſaw the greatneſs of the Electoral Houſes in the preceding Dialogues. And all along where occaſion offers any Political queſtion, he reſolves it briefly; not forgetting the praiſes of men of merit, of Vniverſities, and of Colledges, which are very many in <hi>Germany.</hi> And becauſe it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but there ſhould be ſome jealouſie, hatred or envy between ſo many Houſes of equal condition, he layes down the cauſes thereof; and ſhows how thoſe that precede by turns, take their place; and how many voices they have in the Diets of the Empire; who ought to inherit thoſe Houſes, in caſe they come to be totally extinguiſhed; in what Houſes there is right of Primogeniture, and what Religion they profeſs.</p>

               <p>This Dialogue will give you a perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Eccleſiaſtical Princes of <hi>Germany;</hi> wherein he ſhows how many there were in former times, and how many there are now, as well <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Abbots, Abbeſſes,</hi> as other Eccleſiaſtical Prelates. How many Orders of Knighthood, what power they have, and what obſervance they are under. And becauſe ordinarily ſome Churchman is Director of the Circles of the Empire, he ſpeaks of the Directors of all the Circles; then he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of every Biſhoprick in particular: And afterwards he paſſes to the <hi>Abbots,</hi> and to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the Teutonique Knights; how they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo potent, and how they have loſt thoſe great Provinces they had acquired. After that, he ſhows how the Prelates are become ſo rich; how they obtain their Dignities, which he makes appear not to be after the ſame manner now as anciently.</p>

               <p>Here he ſpeaks of the Counts and Barons of the Empire; and the word Count, called <hi>Graff</hi> in Dutch, gives occaſion to enquire into the origin of <hi>Palſgrave, Margrave, Landgrave,</hi> and <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave,</hi> and to know how many there be, when, and how they became great: from whence the title of Archduke came: and whether the dignity of a
<pb facs="tcp:96329:8"/>Duke was alwayes more illuſtrious then that of a Count: He proves that there are ſeveral ſorts of Dukes and Counts, and confutes the opinion of thoſe that hold, an Emperor ſhould have four Kings under him, a King four Dukes, a Duke four Counts, a Count four Barons, and a Baron four Caſtellans. The Counts were anciently no more then Iudges; and he ſhows how, and at what time they got the inheritance, and became Lords of their Counties. At preſent thoſe of the Empire have place and voice in the Diets, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt equal to the Princes and many of them coyn money. He ſpeaks of the Houſes of <hi>Naſſau, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henzolleren, Furſtemberg,</hi> and of many others in particular; and then he paſſes to the Barons, who differ not from the Counts but in name, and ſets down a Catalogue of them: Then having diſtinguiſhed them from thoſe which the Emperor creates in his Hereditary Provinces, he ends this Dialogue with a touch upon the new Barons, who would have the ſame title that the old ones have.</p>

               <p>Here will be ſeen the difference between a Knight and a Gentleman, and between Knights among themſelves. There are four kinds of them in <hi>Germany,</hi> where the Gentlemen are ſeparated from the Body of the Lords, and are not admitted into the Eſtates of the Empire, though many of them hold immediately of the Emperor; and they
<pb facs="tcp:96329:8"/>are thoſe onely of <hi>Swaben, Franconia,</hi> the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and Lower <hi>Alſatia,</hi> who obſerve a kind of Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratical Republique among themſelves, whereof he ſpeaks at large, as alſo of their Order and their priviledges: Then he paſſes to the Gentlemen Subjects, and becauſe they prove their antiquity by the Turnaments wherein they appeared as Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he ſpeaks of Turnaments, and the Laws therein obſerved heretofore, and at what time, and by whom they were brought into <hi>Germany,</hi> by whom called together, and in what place: From whence he takes occaſion to diſcourſe of the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, their beginning, their beauty, their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, and their incredible power: Then he tells what each Imperial City hath moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and how they preſerve their liberty.</p>

Then he paſſes to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of Juſtice, and ſhowes how it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in the time of the firſt Emperors, and how it is at this preſent: at what time the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament or Chamber of Soverain Iuſtice was made ſedentary, of how many perſons it is compoſed, of what quality they ought to be, and of what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they take cognizance.

                  <p>Such perſons doubtleſs would do more adviſedly to remain in their villages, then to go abroad. Doing ſo, a man may be ignorant without ſerving an apprentiſhip to it: and there is leſs diſhonor in knowing nothing, when one doth not take himſelf to be an able man, then to fancy much after having ſeen the world, and yet not be able to open his mouth without being ridiculous to all the company.

                  <p>Greek words that are found in the Latin Tongue, or Forain terms, which vanity rather than neceſſity hath introduced into ours, do not qualify them to be of the ſame nature with the <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Germans</hi> have admitted thoſe ſtranger words by way of wantonneſs, and may do well enough

                  <p>Yes; for all Hiſtorians do unanimouſly agree, that <hi>Pharamond</hi> the firſt King of <hi>France</hi> was Duke of <hi>Franconia;</hi> that he extended his Empire all along the <hi>Rhine;</hi> that <hi>Clodius</hi> his Son proceeded as far as <hi>Cambray,</hi> and that <hi>Merovée</hi> his Granchild ſetled his Royal Seat in <hi>Paris;</hi> from whence <hi>Clovis</hi> the great

                  <p>Therefore Princes ought to take ſpecial heed that their ſervants make not themſelves great at the expence of their maſters Honour and authority; for a Prince without authority is like a head without eyes, or a body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Soul.</p>

                  <p>Authority is the ſoul of Government, and the reputation of a Prince is the ſupport of his State: without theſe things there is nothing to be ſeen but contempt, diſobedience and rebellion. The moſt moderate ſeeing their Prince devoid of theſe good qualities, deſire that he may obtain them; the moſt Religious pray God to give him them; the moſt coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious grumble; and the moſt ſeditious loſing all reſpect talk of putting another into his place. The unfortunate life and death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Third King of <hi>France,</hi> are unqueſtionable evidences of this truth.</p>

                  <p>Authority depends upon reputation; for the people believing that their Prince is valiant, liberal, and prudent, doth readily obey his will, and receive his Commands with reſpect, honour and reverence. Now to gain the reputation of a prudent Prince, he ſhould be very careful that his ſervants and Miniſters be friends to the publick good, affable, modeſt and generous: To be eſteemed valiant, it is ſufficient that he ſhew a conſtant reſolution to maintain his People in their ancient Splendor, even at the expence of his life; that adverſity caſt him not down, nor proſperity make him inſolent: And to give a fairer luſtre to his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, he ſhould take care that the little he beſtowes, ariſe not out of the oppreſſion of his People. If it be thus indeed, then without being preſent every day at Councel, without drawing his ſword, or giving much, his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, his Friends, and his Enemies too, will eſteem him valiant, liberal, and prudent, and all of them fearing to offend him, will pay him the duties of Subjects, Friends, and Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</p>

                  <p>It is generally ſaid that he was originally a <hi>German;</hi> nay, many think that <hi>Charlemagne</hi> his ſon was born near the <hi>Rhine: John de Serres</hi> in his Inventary of the Hiſtory of <hi>France, Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 315. ſays, he was born at <hi>Wormes,</hi> crowned at <hi>Spire,</hi> and buried at <hi>Aix;</hi> and in <hi>pag.</hi> 324. of the ſame Tome, he ſays, he was buried at <hi>Aix</hi> where he was born.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96329:16"/>would not have been lawful Emperors; and thoſe profeſſing Chriſtianity, who reſided at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> ſince <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great until <hi>Conſtantine Paleologus,</hi> nay, thoſe of <hi>Germany</hi> ſince <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Firſt till this very day, would have been Uſurpers, having been Crowned neither at <hi>Milan</hi> nor <hi>Rome;</hi> which cannot be ſaid without the guilt of High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

                  <p>It held the Empire and <hi>France</hi> together not very long: for the children of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonaire</hi> ſharing their Fathers Eſtates, that diviſion weakned the Houſe, occaſioned Wars between the brethren, and was the cauſe that his Grandchildren loſt the Empire in the year 912. and the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> in the year 987. at which time <hi>Hugh Capet</hi> made <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Lorraine</hi> Unckle by the Fathers ſide to <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fifth to be declared unworthy to ſucceed to the Crown of his Progenitors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had done homage to <hi>Germany</hi> for his Dutchy.

                  <p>War and hunting have great reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, and the good huntſman is, or may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become a good Souldier. To ſurprize the Wolf and the Fox, you muſt uſe a certain ſubtlety, which teaches us to lay ambuſhes for your enemies; to take the wild Boar, you ſhould know how to preſent the Boar-ſpear to the beſt advantage, juſt as you do a Pike or a Halbert when two Bodies of Foot come to puſh a pike; and to ſhoot a Deer and a Hare running, or a Partridge and a Quail flying, you ought to be as good a marks-man as the beſt Fuzillier in an army. Beſides theſe advantages, hunting inures you to endure hunger, thirſt, heat, cold, rain, ſnow, and all the incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the air, without which it is impoſſible to be a good Souldier.</p>

                  <p>I confeſs that hunting hardens us to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and teaches us many things neceſſary for War; but I think I have heard you ſay, that <hi>Louis de Camoes,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Portuguez</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, calls hunting <hi>furia loca inſana,</hi> and doth exceedingly vilifie huntſmen.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Louis de Camoes</hi> is reproved by his Commentator for having ſpoken very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently of the pleaſure of Kings; and they that would excuſe him, ſay that he ſpeaks of none but thoſe that make it their only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and prefer the pleaſure of hunting a Stag, or flying at the Heron, before the ſafety of their Subjects, and their own Honour. However it be, <hi>Camoes</hi> was neither your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter nor your Law-giver; and that which he ſaid, ought not to hinder you from laying ambuſhes to take wild beaſts of all ſorts, nor from going a hunting when your mind ſtands in need of relaxation.</p>

                  <p>You mean then, that after I have ſpent ſome hours at my ſtudy, I ſhould beſtow ſome others upon ſports; becauſe as a Bow ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too long bent, grows weak; ſo the mind when it is too long taken up with contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, begins to diſrelliſh ſtudy, if it be not refreſhed with ſome Gentleman-like recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; in the number of which you place Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as one of the moſt agreable to Princes.</p>

                  <p>It is true, but becauſe youth runs ſo eaſily down the hill towards pleaſures, and that our Nature diſaffects and loaths the occupation of the mind, I would have you hunt as little as poſſibly you can, and that to keep your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in appetite you would prefer Tennis and Fencing before Hunting: for that exerciſe hath ſuch catching baits, and the Princes of

                  <p>I confeſs the ſway of my inclination is abſolutely bent to it, and I could more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly endure the pains of Hunting a whole day, then of ſtudy but two hours.

                  <p>It is no ſmall comfort to me, to hear that you prefer my advice before your pleaſure; but I am ſorry that you call and eſteem that a Labour which is nothing but pure delight. Study would be a ſenſual pleaſure, if the mind were capable of any. They that have once taſted it, can never take themſelves off again; and oftentimes it engages thoſe who are born for action, to give themſelves over to contemplation in ſuch manner, that thereby they become deſpiſeable, and indeed altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſpiſed, drawing upon themſelves the point of thoſe Lances which they have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and the venom of thoſe Pens which they too kindly embrace.</p>

And foraſmuch as by Gods Providence you are born ſuch a one, as will one day have occaſion to render him an account of a Principality, you muſt of neceſſity learn to govern it well, without amuſing your ſelf upon knowledges more curious then uſeful, and which would better become a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor in Philoſophy than the General of an Army.</p>

                  <p>I know that men do not uſe to ſend for Shoe-makers to make their clothes, nor to Taylors to make their boots. Nevertheleſs many Princes enter upon the Government before they have paſt an Apprentiſhip for it, and take the leaſt care of that which concerns them the moſt.

                  <p>Your queſtion doth ſomewhat perplex me: for my part I think them both equally good and graceful, but not equally uſeful; for to know the utility of a Language, it ſhould be conſidered in what part of the world a man inhabits, what perſons he frequents, and with whom he hath to do. <hi>Italian</hi> is in high eſteem and exceedingly uſeful in the Emperors Court, and upon all the Coaſts of the <hi>Mediterranean Sea.</hi> They that trade in <hi>Aſia, Africk</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> with the <hi>Turks, Greeks, Arabians, Candians, Rhodians; Cyprians,</hi> and other <hi>Levantine</hi> people, may commodiouſly make uſe of it. <hi>French</hi> is in greater vogue towards the North, and is marvellouſly well entertained in <hi>Germany, England; Denmark, Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> where all the Kings, Princes and Lords ſpeak it exactly, except the Emperor, who neither loves the <hi>French</hi> nor their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96329:22"/>yet it is ſo much in faſhion, that the chiefeſt <hi>Italians,</hi> nay even the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of his Court, and all others that I have known in <hi>Germany,</hi> ſpeak it, or clip it.</p>

                  <p>Then would it not be better for a <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Prince to learn <hi>French</hi> perfectly, and practiſe it continually, then to amuſe himſelf upon many Languages, and become maſter of never a one of them?</p>

                  <p>I know that travelling is a proper means to accompliſh what you have begun, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not allow that you ſhould imitate thoſe who make it their ſtudy day and night to learn what was done at <hi>Rome</hi> 2000. years ſince, without taking any thought to know how men live in <hi>Germany</hi> at the preſent. They that ſtudy in ſuch a manner, are like thoſe imprudent buſie-bodies, who having their eyes open to ſee what is done among their neighbours, have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to underſtand what is doing in their own houſes.

                  <p>The Ancients have written but few things touching our Empire, and modern writers do ſo much ſerve and humour their own paſſion, that it is hard to ſee clear in what they deliver: yet becauſe it imports you more to underſtand <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> then other Countreys, I am content to anſwer unto every thing which you ſhall be pleaſed to ask me concerning the State of the Empire.

                  <p>We will ſpeak, if you pleaſe, of the head

                  <p>Strangers are to blame, when they ſpeak of what they know not; and all men, when they write contrary to their own judgement.

                  <p>The Emperor being a man, and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, is obliged to obſerve both Humane and Divine Laws; and becauſe he promiſes and ſwears not to do any thing contrary to the Capitulation which the Electors preſcribe to him after his Election, doubtleſs he is bound to keep it, in like manner as all Kings are, not to

                  <p>That title is communicated to them with that of Elector, Duke or Prince; and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth us, that when a Count, who was not ſuch <hi>by the grace of God,</hi> is raiſed to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a Prince, he forthwith takes the quality of Prince <hi>by the grace of God:</hi> From whence it follows, that as no man is Elector, Duke or Prince, but by the Emperors grant, in like manner theſe Princes are not qualified ſo, but
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:96329:25"/>by way of Communication. Nay, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they ſhould be abſolutely indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of any but God, being (as they are) Subjects of the Empire, receiving their dignity from the Emperor, and doing him Homage for their Principalities.</p>

                  <p>In the year 1623. the Emperor <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> II. transferred the Electoral dignity from <hi>Frederick</hi> V. Count Palatine to <hi>Maximilian</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria.</hi> This tranſlation of dignity, and many other acts of Soverainty, which the Empire remarked in <hi>Ferdinand</hi> with a jealous eye; as the taking upon himſelf alone to decide
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:96329:31"/>matters which cannot be determined, but by the judgement of all the Eſtates of the Empire; the reſuming of Church-lands poſſeſſed by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and giving them to Religious Orders; together with a fear of worſe proceedings, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the Princes to joyn in a League, and to call ſtrangers to their aſſiſtance. The War was long, and ſo bloody, that it ſwept away more then half the people of <hi>Germany.</hi> At laſt both ſides being weary, an Aſſembly was held at <hi>Munſter</hi> to conclude a Peace, and the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors there found themſelves in a great ſtrait how to ſatisfie the two principal branches of that Houſe. Each of them pretended to the Electorate; the firſt, having had poſſeſſion thereof for many ages, required the reſtitution of it; and the ſecond, alledging the ſignal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices he had done the Empire, by which he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited that recompenſe, would not conſent to the Peace, unleſs it were provided that he ſhould ſtill enjoy that honor. In concluſion, as <hi>Maximilian</hi> had many friends, ſo <hi>Charles Lewis</hi> did not want his ſupports: Whereupon they came to this agreement, That <hi>Maximili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> ſhould have the firſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorſhip to him and his poſterity, and an eighth place ſhould be new-erected for <hi>Charles Lewis</hi> Prince Palatine of the <hi>Rhine;</hi> upon this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if the <hi>Gulielmine</hi> branch hapned to fail before the <hi>Rodolphine,</hi> theſe latter ſhould re-enter into their ancient Electorſhip, and the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:96329:31"/>other newly created ſhould be wholly aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                  <p>I do not wonder that theſe Princes did ſo earneſtly deſire, the one to recover, and the other to keep the Electorate in his Branch; ſince it is believed, that this dignity makes the poſſeſſors thereof not inferior to Kings.</p>

                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>The Electoral dignity is very great; and they that are endued with it, are in a more eminent degree then other Potentates of the Empire, becauſe they have power to make the Emperor: But I do not think they may be equalled to Kings. Nay, I remember I have read, that the laſt Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> of the blood Royal of <hi>France,</hi> demanded precedence before the Electors at the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and obtained his pretence.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>I know, that Duke alledging his high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent, and the many Dutchies, Counties, and other Lordſhips in his poſſeſſion, obtained a declaration from the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> that in regard of his condition and his great Eſtates, he ſhould precede the Secular Electors. But you alſo know, that the Electors have taken place of Kings upon ſome occaſions.</p>

                  <p>The King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> gives place to many others, except when he is in the Diet for the Election of an Emperor; and in the like caſe the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> hath diſputed the precedence with <hi>Rodolph</hi> II. King of <hi>Hungary.</hi> Nevertheleſs it is out of controverſie, that the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:96329:32"/>Electoral dignity is inferior to the Royal: And it may be proved by the order which the Electors themſelves obſerve; for the Elector of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> when he was but Duke, had the loweſt place, but having obtained the title of King, he began to go before his Collegues, only becauſe it was not thought reaſonable that a Royal perſon, Crowned and Anointed, ſhould give way to thoſe that were but barely Electors.</p>

                  <p>Though this dignity do not ſtand upon equal terms with that of Kings, it is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs very great; but who is the chiefeſt among the Electors?</p>

                  <p>None of them diſputes the precedencie with him of <hi>Mentz,</hi> who is Dean of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoral Colledge, appoints the day and place of the Election, when the Emperor is dead, or when it is neceſſary to chooſe a King of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> The ſecond is the Elector of <hi>Tryer,</hi> the third of <hi>Collen.</hi> Thus the Eccleſiaſticks take place of the Secular Princes; of whom the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> is the firſt, the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> the ſecond, the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> the third, the Marquiſs of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> the fourth, and the Count Palatine the laſt. Notwithſtanding which order I muſt think the Electors of the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Saxony</hi> to be above all the reſt, becauſe during the vacancy of the Empire they are Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars thereof, and can do all that is in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors power (except giving Inveſtiture to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:96329:32"/>thoſe that hold great Territories or Lordſhips in Fee of the Empire) without being ſubject to give an account of their adminiſtration.</p>

                  <p>The Empire being deſtitute of a Head, by the natural death of the Emperor, by his own ſpontaneous demiſſion, or by his demerit, when for his unworthineſs he is deprived of it, they proceed to the election of another.</p>

                  <p>Both the one and the other have been ſeen more then once; and that we may not go too far back to ſeek for examples very remote from our time, it ſhall be ſufficient for me to tell you, that <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> ſon to <hi>Charles</hi> IV. being become unfit for the Imperial Crown, was forced to ſurrender it unto <hi>Robert</hi> the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Palatine in the year 1400. And when <hi>Charles</hi> V. had ſurpaſſed all his predeceſſors in merit, and ſhown by nine voyages, which he made into <hi>Germany,</hi> ſix into <hi>Spain,</hi> ſeven into <hi>Italy,</hi> four into <hi>France,</hi> ten into the Low-Countreys, two into <hi>England,</hi> as many into <hi>Africa,</hi> and by paſſing the Ocean and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean Seas eleven times, that nothing was impoſſible to a Prince of his reſolution; he would further manifeſt, that he knew how to conquer himſelf, and having called his ſon <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:96329:33"/>into the Netherlands, he put the Scepter of <hi>Spain</hi> with all its dependancies into his hands, and by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Naſſau</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> ſent the Imperial Crown to his brother, who was already King of the <hi>Romans:</hi> After which he retired himſelf to a quiet ſolitude in the year 1556. where he lived two more in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of heavenly joys, and went to receive them the 21. of <hi>September</hi> 1558.</p>

                  <p>It is a wonder that a Prince ſo inclined to honor the holy See, did not reſign his Scepter into the hands of the Pope.</p>

                  <p>That incomparable Monarch loved to have the See of <hi>Rome</hi> flouriſh, but was not willing the glory thereof ſhould be illuſtrated by the eclipſe of the Empire. He knew what he ought to the Church, and what to <hi>Germany:</hi> He was not ignorant that the Conſtitutions of Popes aim at the weakning of the Empire, and the diminution of its authority; but he knew alſo how to put a difference betwixt juſt and unjuſt. And by that action he maintained the right of the Empire, and yet did wrong to no body.</p>

                  <p>There are that think it ought not to be done, becauſe it is as much as to give occaſion to one to wiſh the death of another. Yet expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which is more to be conſidered then the ſpeculative fancies of Doctors, teaches us,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:96329:33"/>that <hi>Charles</hi> IV. <hi>Wenceſlaus, Maximilian</hi> I. and II. <hi>Rodolph</hi> II. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> III. and IV. were choſen in the life-time of their predeceſſors.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:96329:36"/>not think that rationally one can be preferred before the other, but with reſpect to places, times, and perſons. <hi>Germany, Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Poland</hi> find it expedient to elect their Princes: The <hi>French, Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Swedes</hi> like it better that the Son or neareſt Kinſman ſhould ſucceed their Kings. The reaſons of thoſe that prefer Succeſſion, are plauſible. They ſay, that ordinarily in the time of the <hi>Interregnum,</hi> Elective Monarchies fall into Anarchy, diſorders, and the danger of utter ruine, being like a ſhip in a ſtorm without a Pilot; that Elective Princes, having no aſſured hope to tranſmit the Crown to their children, endeavour to enrich them at the charge of the publick, and that no man hath ſo great a care to preſerve anothers eſtate as his own. They add further, that perſons of low degree are elected, who become inſolent upon it, and leave no ſtone unturned to make the Crown Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to their Family; and which is ſtill worſe ſometimes the Electors being at variance, inſtead of one Head ſet many over the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. But all theſe reaſons are good and allowable in thoſe States where Succeſſion hath had place for many ages. The <hi>Germans</hi> had rather have their Emperors by choice; and to prevent thoſe inconveniences, they many times elect a Succeſſor to the Empire while the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror is living: And though that courſe be not taken, yet the Empire is not in danger to fall
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:96329:36"/>into Anarchy or any diſorder, ſeeing the Electors <hi>Palatine</hi> and of <hi>Saxony</hi> are Vicars of the Emperor, and Adminiſtrators of the Empire during the <hi>Interregnum.</hi> And ſo the ſhip is never without a Pilot in <hi>Germany;</hi> where to abate the deſire which the Emperors may have to agrandize their children by weakning the Monarchy, they uſually make choice of the neareſt of Kin to the Reigning Prince; and they do not transfer the Crown to another Houſe, but when they find never a Head wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of it in that Family that hath it in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This way of continuing the Imperial Dignity in one Houſe doth alſo hinder the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of advancing men of low degree to the Throne, and of giving two Heads at a time to one ſingle Common-wealth. For which cauſe I think it not fit to innovate any thing in a State, and that every Nation ſhould perſevere in their ancient cuſtomes, foraſmuch as all changes in a State are dangerous.</p>

When a Kingdom is Succeſſive, the people is often forced to obey a child, or rather thoſe who abuſing his authority do oppreſs and exhauſt his Subjects during his Minority.

                  <p>You will meet with ſome Writers, who mean the Emperor when they are ſpeaking of the King of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and yet they are diſtinct perſons: For no man can be Vicar to himſelf, and the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> is the Emperors perpetual Vicar; when the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is abſent, or taken up with other affairs, he adminiſters the Empire, and the Emperor being dead he ſucceeds without diſpute. The King of the <hi>Romans</hi> bears for his Arms the Eagle with one head, the Emperor with two; he is ſtyled <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and the Emperor <hi>ſemper Auguſtus:</hi> The Emperor writing to him uſeth the term of <hi>Liebten</hi> in Dutch, which ſignifies <hi>Dilection,</hi> but he writing or ſpeaking to the Emperor, gives him that of <hi>Majeſty:</hi> To conclude, he acknowledges the Emperor for his Superior, and though in his abſence he exerciſe the ſame power the Emperor did, it is but by conceſſion, for he hath no authority of his own within the Empire, ſo long as the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:96329:38"/>Emperor is living: And therefore if he take place of other Kings, it is only becauſe he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth the ſame Juriſdiction which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror doth.</p>

                  <p>Heretofore there were 3.

                  <p>In thoſe Ceremonies the Elector of <hi>Collen</hi> did for a long time Crown the Emperor; but becauſe the Archbiſhops of that <hi>See</hi> have not been Prieſts for near a hundred years laſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:96329:39"/>paſt, he of <hi>Mentz</hi> performed that Office: And at the Inauguration of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> III. there was a diſpute between thoſe two Electors for he of <hi>Collen</hi> being a Prieſt at that time, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to recover that honour; and he of <hi>Mentz.</hi> pleading the poſſeſſion of his Predeceſſors, urged that he ſhould be upheld and continued in that Right. In concluſion, notwithſtanding the oppoſition of the Elector of <hi>Collen,</hi> he of <hi>Mentz</hi> executed the Office; and ſome believe that he did but preſerve a Right which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to <hi>Mentz</hi> before. The Diadem of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients was certain white Scarfs, with which they bound the head of their Kings; at this time it is a Crown, which the Golden Bull calls <hi>Infula.</hi> It belongs to the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> to carry that; as the bearing of the Ball to the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> of the Sword to the <hi>Saxon,</hi> and of the Sceptre to the <hi>Brandenburger.</hi> The Imperial cloak is richly ſet with pretious ſtones, and is faſtned together with a golden buckle over the breaſt.</p>

                  <p>The Electors do not give the Emperor the power he hath; for that power is inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably annexed to the Imperial dignity. But they make choice of a Prince, they declare him worthy of Majeſty, they give him the Scepter, they ſet him upon the Throne, and ſalute him Emperor. From this dignity proceeds the right of making Univerſal Laws, of creating Kings, Electors, Archdukes, Dukes, Marquiſſes, Landgraves, Counts, Barons, Gentlemen; and of depriving them of that honor, when they behave themſelves unworthily. For he that can give a dignity, can likewiſe take it away. He can alſo make Notaries, Tabellions, and Doctors; nay, erect Univerſities, where men that deſerve it may be declared, created, and made Doctors: He can legitimate Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards, reſtore to honor, give the benefit of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:96329:40"/>age, erect Parliaments and other Courts of Juſtice, judge without Appeal, and give In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture to ſuch as hold great Territories in Fee of the Empire: He hath power of life and death, can give ſafe-guards, ſet up Poſts, and raiſe ordinary Burroughs into the rank and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Cities.</p>

                  <p>For the declaring of War, he muſt have the conſent of the Eſtates, who heretofore might refuſe to aid him with men and money.

Regalities may be alſo diſtinguiſhed into the greater and the leſſer: The greater are <hi>Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Dignity,</hi> which relate to the Emperor perſon; the leſſer are <hi>Regalities of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility</hi> which regard his Treaſure.

                  <p>Many Writers fetch the Original of theſe Princes out of the loines of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> and follow the Genealogie down from him to thoſe that are living at this day. For my part, I know not what to think of it, and therefore refer my ſelf to real evidence. Yet I dare confidently affirm, that the Houſe is very ancient; and that ſince the year 1253. in which <hi>Otho Witelpachius</hi> Count of <hi>Shiern</hi> married <hi>Agnes</hi> heireſs of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> this Houſe hath poſſeſſed thoſe two great Principalities, with the quality of Elector, and great Steward of

It hath given two Emperors to <hi>Germany,</hi> one King to <hi>Denmark, Sweden</hi> and <hi>Norway</hi> joyntly, and another to <hi>Sweden</hi> alone: Without counting I know not how many Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, who have commanded armies in <hi>Italy, Hungary, France</hi> and <hi>England.</hi>

But as things of this world are of ſhort continuance, that Houſe failed totally in the year 1583. and that of <hi>Saxony</hi> took poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the eſtate by vertue of a Confraternity made between thoſe Princes in the year 1554. This Principality is ſituated partly upon the mountain and foreſt of <hi>Thuringia,</hi> partly on this ſide towards <hi>Franconia.</hi> It remains undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſtill, becauſe the Elector, who hath five eighth ſhares in it, hath not been willing to make partitions in ſeveralty, as the Dukes of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tembourg, Weymar,</hi> and <hi>Gotta</hi> deſired him to do. This Countrey lies very commodiouſly for the Princes of <hi>Saxony,</hi> becauſe it joyns their Landgraveſhip of <hi>Thuringia</hi> with the lands they hold in <hi>Franconia,</hi> and gives them a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of great difficulty in that mountain. To conclude, this Houſe is potent by the extent and fertility of its lands, by the great number of Nobility there inhabiting, by its good mines of Silver and Copper, and by the excellent For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of <hi>Leipſick, Wittenberg, Dreſden, Ko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigſtein,</hi> and many others, which put theſe Princes above parallel, as well as that Soverain Juſtice they all exerciſe upon their own lands, from which no man is allowed to appeal.</p>

                  <p>The Reformed Religion, whereof this Elector makes profeſſion, differing from that of his Subjects, he is thereby leſs powerful in my opinion; and if he would embrace the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran, which his Grandfather forſook, and (as many believe) only out of worldly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, he would enlarge his power, and (if I be not deceived) his Subjects would have more confidence in him.</p>

                  <p>There is no doubt to be made, but that Sciences do enhance and adorn the Titles and Souls of Princes, as diadems do their heads, and jewels their Crowns: And although this quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be very rare, yet it is neceſſary to thoſe that would rule happily and gloriouſly. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Alexander</hi> the Great, <hi>Ptolomee, Iulius Ceſar, Auguſtus,</hi> the two <hi>Antonines,</hi> and <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> had never attained to ſo great renown, if they had not aſſociated Letters with the ſword, and learning with valour.

                  <p>The firſt and moſt neceſſary Philoſophy of a Prince, is to know how to do juſtice to his People, and defend them from their enemies. And to that end I think he ſhould ſtudy to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thoſe perſons that are able to ſerve him well, and not to neglect the Mathematicks, which teach him both to beſiege and fortifie places as he ought, to form Battalions and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, to entrench a Camp, and to take his advantage. As to other things, I do not deſire that a Prince ſhould ſpend his time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Logical notions, nor that he ſhould like a Pedant be evermore bringing out ſome verſe
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:96329:67"/>of <hi>Horace.</hi> It is ſufficient that he be ready in Sacred and Prophane Hiſtory, that he take a delight in Books, and conſult the dead, to learn of them what none of the living dare tell him.</p>

                  <p>It is as great a fault to aim at knowing too much, as to learn nothing at all. The Prince that hath ſtudied too much, deſpiſeth his Counſellors, and will fetch all his counſels out of his own head; and he that hath learnt nothing, is not capable to make choice of the beſt advices. He that would oblige a great Lord to make himſelf as perfect in the Sciences as they that make it their profeſſion, deſerves no leſs blame then if he ſhould forbid him to learn above three words of Latine. Learn then to expreſs your mind in good terms, read ſuch books as may teach you to know the condition of your friends and of your adverſaries, be well inſtructed in truly Chriſtian Politicks, let it be your care diſtinctly to know thoſe that love the publick Intereſt, honor them with ſuch offices as they deſerve, and leave the reſt to your ſervants.</p>

It hath a Countrey, where the Mountains abound in Mines, Wines, and Woods; the Foreſts are well ſtored with Timber-trees, Game and Veniſon of all kinds; the Valleys are a continuation of Meadows co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Cattle, and watered with Brooks full of Fiſh; the Plains are thick ſet with Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and the Gardens like thoſe of the <hi>Heſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rides,</hi> or rather like earthly <hi>Paradiſes.</hi> There is in no place to be ſeen fairer rows of Orange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trees, Grotta's better contrived and beautifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Fountains more artificial, nor Fruits more pleaſant to the ſight and taſte, then at <hi>Stut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardt.</hi> Few Princes have a houſe of Pleaſure and a Heronry within their Garden, as this Duke hath; neither is there any one in the Empire, that hath a greater care of the Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and of Learned perſons. They that have been at <hi>Tubing,</hi> know how many Princes, Counts, Lords, Barons, and Gentlemen have been bred in the noble Colledge which Duke <hi>Lewis</hi> cauſed to be built, and which his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors do ſplendidly maintain there.</p>

This Colledge and this Univerſity are the Pearls which do wonderfully ſet off the Crown of this Duke: For although he be exceedingly at his eaſe, though he have whatſoever he can wiſh, though the delight of Hunting never fail him, though every day preſent him ſome new delicacies made or growing upon his own Territories; yet he would be much leſs ſpoken of in Forain Countreys, if <hi>Eberhard</hi> the Wiſe had not foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Univerſity, if <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> the Prudent had not projected this Colledge, if <hi>Lewis</hi> the Pious had not built it, if <hi>Frederick</hi> the Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous had not endowed it, if <hi>John Frederick</hi> the Peaceable had not preſerved it, and if <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berhard</hi> the Conſtant had not raiſed it to a higher point for the good of the Princes, Lords and Gentlemen of the Empire.</p>

                  <p>Order being the eſſential principle of all Societies, Laws have been made that appoint every one what he is to do, and what he is to avoid.

                  <p>You will acknowledge that this Sex is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally weak, inconſtant, and faint-hearted; and that it is not able either to ride, or wear ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour for the good of the State.</p>

                  <p>It is the opinion of thoſe, who to decry Ladies, tell us, they are naturally inconſtant, fearful, and cruel; and when we object the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious examples of <hi>Roman, Grecian, Spaniſh, German,</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Ladies, they ſay, they are rare things, and ſuch as ought not to be
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:96329:77"/>drawn into conſequence; and that for one that hath adminiſtred the State well, there be two that have abuſed their authority. I confeſs they are not all ſufficiently qualified to rule; but I deny alſo that all men are ſo: And I may confidently ſay, that never any King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was better obeyed then Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that the braveſt <hi>Swediſh</hi> Commanders freely acknowledged, their victories proceeded as much from the happy <hi>Genius</hi> of their Queen as from their own valour; that <hi>Portugal</hi> ows its deliverance to <hi>Loyſe de Guſman,</hi> who governs it ſtill with admirable prudence; that <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> of <hi>France</hi> wife to <hi>Philip</hi> IV. would have re-eſtabliſhed the affairs of <hi>Spain,</hi> if the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency of a Favourite had not held her at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the Counſels of the King her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; that the <hi>Heſſians</hi> were never better ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led then by <hi>Amelia Elizabeth,</hi> and that no Prince was ever more moderate in his proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor more conſtant in adverſity then this matchleſs Lady. One example ſhall make you confeſs this truth. In the year 1647. her Army beſieged <hi>Paderborne,</hi> and was forced to raiſe the ſiege with loſs. The news came to her while ſhe ſate at Table; ſhe read the Letter, and told me, We have ill news, my Troops have been worſted, and forced to leave a plate which it concerned me very much to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: And ſo ſate out her Meal without the leaſt ſhow of any alteration.</p>

                  <p>I perceive you love that beautiful Sex, and underſtand their worth; and if they had no greater enemies then you, they ſhould have the honour that is due to them. I ſhall always be of the ſame opinion, and if ten thouſand Philoſophers would perſwade me the contrary, I ſhould not forbear to ſay and believe, that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:96329:78"/>there be many Ladies worthy to govern, and would be many more, if they were inſtructed and brought up to great affairs from their youth.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Princes, as well as all that are An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, hear many men ſpeak of the beginning of their Houſe, but few that ſpeak truth. I do not deſire to confute opinions contrary to mine, nor to entertain you long upon ſuch a ſubject: It is enough for me to tell you what I have learnt from thoſe Marquiſſes themſelves, who have graciouſly communicated to me what they have drawn out of their own Records. But before we go any further, I deſire you to take notice, that the Houſe of <hi>Heſſe</hi> being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:96329:78"/>into two Branches, whereof one follows <hi>Luthers</hi> Reformation, and the other <hi>Calvins;</hi> each of them hath one Prince that hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn himſelf to the Church of <hi>Rome: Frederick</hi> brother to the Landgrave <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Darmſtadt,</hi> &amp; grand Prior of the Order of <hi>Malta</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> and <hi>Erneſt</hi> Unkle by the Fathers ſide to the Landgrave <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Caſſel,</hi> who making as if he would diſpute with the ableſt men of the two Religions permitted by the Laws of the Empire, hath embraced that of <hi>Rome,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his Wife, who is of the Houſe of <hi>Solmes.</hi>

                  <p>I was not ignorant of that change of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which hath made noiſe enough through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Germany.</hi> As for thoſe Writers that fetch what they deliver concerning the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Houſes, either out of their own brain, or from weak conjectures, I think they are much to blame: For my part, I conceive there is no better way to know from what ſource Houſes are derived, then by the Charters and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphs of the Houſes themſelves.</p>

                  <p>There are ſome that think Princes flatter themſelves in this point, and report fables for truths, on purpoſe to appear more illuſtrious and more ancient. And I am verily perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that many endeavour to uſurp the Eſtates of others by vain and falſe Genealogies; nay, that our nature cannot endure any that doth not flatter it: On the other ſide I cannot deny,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:96329:79"/>but that Princes themſelves, or their learned ſervants, who have the cuſtody of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, muſt know the truth of their beginning and off-ſpring better then any other perſon.

                  <p>They that would have this Houſe come out of <hi>Italy,</hi> ſay that <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa</hi> brought <hi>Herman</hi> Marquiſs of <hi>Verona</hi> from thence, and gave him the Marquiſate of <hi>Hoch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg:</hi> which cannot be, ſeeing in the time of the Emperor <hi>Conrade</hi> II. there were already Marquiſſes at <hi>Baden</hi> and at <hi>Hochberg.</hi> It is therefore more probable, that <hi>Berchtold</hi> I, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving two ſons, divided his Eſtates between them, giving the greateſt part thereof to his eldeſt ſon <hi>Berchtold</hi> II. with the title of Duke of <hi>Zeringuen,</hi> and a good ſhare to <hi>Herman</hi> his younger ſon, with the title of Marquiſs. This <hi>Herman</hi> II. having married <hi>Judith</hi> inheritrice of <hi>Baden,</hi> gave occaſion to <hi>Herman</hi> III. whom
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:96329:79"/>he had by her, to ſtyle himſelf Marquiſs of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> to take his Mothers Arms, and tranſmit them to his poſterity, as he did. Some while after, the Emperor <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ruined <hi>Milan,</hi> and chaſtiſed <hi>Lombardy,</hi> put German garriſons in all the ſtrong places, and left <hi>Herman</hi> IV. Governor of <hi>Verona.</hi> When that Prince came back into <hi>Germany,</hi> he was called Marquiſs of <hi>Verona</hi> in memory of that Expedition; and that name hath occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the miſtake of thoſe who write that the Marquiſſes of <hi>Baden</hi> are deſcended from them of <hi>Verona.</hi>

                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>Then you hold it for certain, that the Marquiſſes of <hi>Baden</hi> are deſcended neither from the <hi>Gothick</hi> Kings, nor from the <hi>Scaligers,</hi> nor the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſins,</hi> nor from any Marquiſſes of <hi>Verona</hi> whatſoever; but from the ancient Counts of <hi>Vindoniſſa</hi> and <hi>Altembourg,</hi> who flouriſhed a long time in <hi>Swiſſerland:</hi> from whom alſo the Dukes of <hi>Zeringuen</hi> and <hi>Tek,</hi> the Counts of <hi>Habſpourg</hi> and the Archdukes derive their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal.</p>

                  <p>That is my opinion; and I believe it as true, as it is certain that <hi>Herman</hi> Marquiſs of <hi>Baden</hi> founded a Monaſtery in his Village of <hi>Backenau, A.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:96329:80"/>All which things were done by Marquiſſes of <hi>Baden</hi> (before there were any, according to the opinion of my Adverſaries) and by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendents of <hi>Herman</hi> ſon to <hi>Berchtold</hi> Duke of <hi>Zeringuen.</hi>

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:96329:84"/>own hereditary Principalities. That <hi>Frederick</hi> was the firſt Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> which is held in Fee of the Empire, as <hi>Schleſwick</hi> is of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark;</hi> but neither he, nor his ſon <hi>Chriſtian</hi> III. durſt ſend any body to the Diets, fearing they ſhould be but ill uſed for having aſſumed the place of a brother-in-law to two Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>

                  <p>No man denies but that theſe Houſes ſprung out of one and the ſame root, and that they are reckoned amongſt the ancienteſt in Chriſtendom; but I hold it a vanity to enquire for a deſcent from Father to Son ever ſince <hi>Adams</hi> time to ours; becauſe the Ancients were more ſtudious to deſerve an immortal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, then to ſeek for Writers to tranſmit the ſame to poſterity. The Author of the Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Tables which the Prince <hi>Auguſtus</hi> gave me at <hi>Pleskau</hi> in the year 1650. Affirms, that theſe Princes were Kings, Dukes, and Generals of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> even before the coming of Chriſt; and ſets down for Head of this Family <hi>Berenthobald,</hi> who in the quality of King led the <hi>Saxons</hi> to the War againſt <hi>Hermanford</hi> King of <hi>Thuringia,</hi> A. <hi>D.</hi> 524. <hi>Limneus</hi> goes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſaying they come from <hi>Aſcana</hi> ſon to <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Iaphet Noahs</hi> ſon.

                  <p>Thoſe titles were not always Hereditary. Anciently the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and many other people choſe a Duke or a King, when they ſtood in need of one for the War; otherwiſe their State was Ariſtocratical, and Dignities deſcended not to their heirs. In the days of <hi>Charlemagne Witikind</hi> Head of the <hi>Saxons</hi> had <hi>Aribo Beran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> (his Son or Brother-in-law) for his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General: And when they were van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by the valour of <hi>Charles,</hi> and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to him by the mediation of <hi>Henry</hi> Count of <hi>Henneberg, Charlemagne</hi> honored <hi>Witikind</hi> with the quality of Duke, and <hi>Aribo Beranger</hi> with that of Count of <hi>Aſcania, Ballenstet,</hi> and <hi>Hircinia,</hi> to them and their poſterity. When they were dead, the Deſcendents of that Houſe became Chriſtians, and the Emperor was God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father to <hi>Charles,</hi> Father to <hi>Poppo,</hi> who took to wife <hi>Syndovine</hi> daughter to <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naire</hi> Emperor and King of <hi>France;</hi> from whom all the princes of this Houſe are propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.</p>

                  <p>A King gives account of his actions to none but God, and can do almoſt all that he will; he ought nevertheleſs to act equitably, and not to plunge men of courage into deſpair, then which nothing is more dangerous. They that have loſt their eſtate, think they have nothing more to loſe, and are capable of making the greateſt repent of the wrongs they have done them. The Soverain then may take back the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:96329:90"/>benefits he beſtowed, when he that received them is become altogether unworthy of them: But before he come to that extremity, he ſhould endeavour to reduce them unto their duty; and having tryed all fair means, he muſt be very, careful that he do not faintly and looſely execute the reſolutions that he hath generouſly taken; nor raſhly undertake a great action, which prudence will afterwards perſwade him to abandon. A Prince ſhould think ſeriouſly of a thing before he enters upon it; but having begun, he ſhould carry it through: For there is nothing ſo repugnant to the of authority Kings, as to act by halves; nor any thing that ſo much encourages Subjects to Rebellion, as to ſee that their Maſters are afraid of them.</p>

                  <p>Every man ſhould take a true meaſure of his ability, and give no more then he can well bear. Prodigality hath a ſemblance of ſomething more noble then avarice hath, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:96329:92"/>really it is leſs odious: nay, they that gain by it, make it paſs for a vertue; but perchance it is more prejudicial to poſterity, and no leſs dangerous then the other extreme. Though a King ſhould give away his whole Kingdom, he would not ſatisfie all that ask, no nor all that think they deſerve much of him. It is then more convenient to give with reaſon, &amp; never to draw ſo near the bottom, but that Great men may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes have wherewithal to gratifie perſons of merit; and above all, they ſhould take ſpecial care that their liberality be exerciſed without the oppreſſion of the People, to avoid murmuring which may produce Rebellion.</p>

                  <p>There is never a Countrey in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom where Prelates have ſo much power as in <hi>Germany.</hi> They are almoſt all Great Princes, and as abſolute over the Temporalty of their Benefices, as a Secular Elector is over his Lands.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:96329:96"/>as well as their evil converſation.

                  <p>Theſe Princes give themſelves but little (if at all) to their ſtudies, miſuſing their rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and think it beneath their greatneſs to preach the word of God, and do other Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical functions: But they do not all live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>

                  <p>Whatever is ſpoken againſt ungodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, doth nothing concern the truly religious. There are Prelates of ſundry conditions, and different humors; ſome are voluptuous, and others chaſt; ſome love nothing but dogs and bouffons, others make much of worthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Heretofore, beſides the three Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Electors, there were five Archbiſhops, and thirty Biſhops that had ſeat and voice in the Aſſemblies of the Empire: At this time there are not ſo many, becauſe the Archbiſhopricks of <hi>Magdebourg, Bremen,</hi> and <hi>Riga,</hi> and the Biſhopricks of <hi>Halberſtad, Minden,</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> have been changed into Secular Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; as thoſe alſo of <hi>Beſanſon, Verdun, Mets,</hi> and <hi>Toul,</hi> were diſmembred from the Empire, and inſeparably united to the Lands of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> by the laſt Treaty of Peace: And
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:96329:96"/>thoſe of <hi>Valeſia, Loſanna,</hi> and <hi>Chur,</hi> have been aboliſhed by the <hi>Suiſſes.</hi> So that at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there is none but <hi>Saltzbourg</hi> that holds the rank of Archbiſhop in the Colledge of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and about twenty Biſhops.</p>

                  <p>Dignities are not only conſiderable for the ſtrength, riches, and beauty of a place, but alſo, and more eſpecially, for the rank they give unto the perſons that poſſeſs them. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Saltzbourg</hi> is Legate born of the Apoſtolick See; he alternates with the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dukes in the Diets of the Empire, and gives place to none but the Electors. <hi>Paris,</hi> Count of <hi>Ladron,</hi> was long in poſſeſſion of this Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice with great honour, and when he dyed, made room for <hi>Gardobaldi</hi> Count of <hi>Thurin,</hi> who comes not behind him either in vertue or magnificence.</p>

                  <p>The Catholick Biſhops that ſtill enjoy a ſeat and ſuffrage in the Aſſemblies of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, are, <hi>Bamberg, Wirsbourg, Wormes, Spire, Eichſtedt, Augsbourg, Conſtance, Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſheim, Paderborne, Munſter, Oſnabrug, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau, Strasbourg, Friſinguen, Liege, Trent, Brix,</hi> and <hi>Baſile;</hi> of which nevertheleſs <hi>Oſna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brug</hi> belongs to the Catholicks only by turns, and after the death of <hi>Francis</hi> Count of <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg,</hi> a moſt venerable Prelate, who was
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:96329:98"/>plenipotentiary of the Eccleſiaſtical Electors at <hi>Munſter,</hi> and gave great proof of his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, dexterity, and magnificence, to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and with the admiration of all the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly; I ſay, after his death, <hi>Erneſt Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> Duke of <hi>Lunebourg</hi> ſhall be Biſhop of <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabrug,</hi> though he be a Lutheran.

                  <p>That of <hi>Bamberg</hi> is the firſt of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; it acknowledges no Metropolitan, but depends immediately upon the Pope, and its Subjects cannot appeal from the Juſtice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This Biſhoprick is of Imperial foundation, and the Biſhop hath right to receive the Oath
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:96329:98"/>which the Electors are to take to the Emperor for their Offices of Great Cup-bearer, Great Steward, Great Marſhal, and Great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlain: And which is to be admired, theſe Electors were anciently hereditary great Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers, great Stewards, great Marſhals, and great Chamberlains to this Biſhop, who in that had the ſame honour the Emperor hath, though every one thought it ſtrange to ſee the greateſt Princes of the Empire in the ſervice of a Gentleman. He that is Biſhop at preſent ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>Melchior Otho Voite</hi> of <hi>Salsbourg,</hi> and is of the ſame Houſe that he was of. This Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late is exceedingly well lodged at <hi>Bamberg,</hi> where he hath pleaſant gardens, and excellent walks of Orange-trees: but the City is weak, which enforces the Biſhop to betake himſelf unto ſome other place in the time of Wars.</p>

                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Thoſe Princes value the Canonryes more, becauſe upon that account they are Members of the Chapter of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> then for the Revenue they yield, which in truth is hardly ſufficient to maintain a ſervant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Augsbourg</hi> is famous throughout the World, for the beauty of the City, for the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Goldſmiths and other Artiſans that make a thouſand curioſities, and becauſe in the year 1530. the Proteſtant Princes did there preſent their Confeſſion of Faith to the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> V.</p>

                     <hi>Conſtance</hi> is known throughout all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom by reaſon of the Council held there, by order whereof <hi>John Hus</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> were burnt without any reſpect had to the Safe-Conduct of the Emperor <hi>Sigiſmond.</hi>

                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>The moſt rational Catholiques abhor that maxime; which if allowed, deſtroyes Commerce, ruines Treaties, foments Wars, ſowes Diſcord, quenches Charity, and diſannuls Religion. A Prince ſhould eſteem nothing more
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:96329:101"/>precious then his word, nothing more vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then his faith, nor more ſacred then his promiſe. King <hi>Francis</hi> I. ſaid, that if faith were utterly vaniſht out of the World, it ſhould be found in his word: And <hi>Charles</hi> V. having given his to Doctor <hi>Luther,</hi> obſerved it religiouſly. It is true indeed, that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi> not willing that <hi>Luthers</hi> Reformation ſhould be charged upon that incomparable Emperor, ſay that he kept his faith, becauſe Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> had already written much, and that it would have been more prejudicial to the Church to put him to death, then to let him live. But that cannot be affirmed without too much diminution to the Glory of that great Prince. Be careful then of promiſing a thing, the obſerving whereof may be of damage to you; but make good your promiſe what ever it coſt you; and though you ſhould have paſt your word to a <hi>Turk,</hi> do what you have undertaken.</p>

                  <p>It is generally ſaid, that a man ſhould keep his promiſe, but doth that rule admit of no exception?</p>

                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Thoſe things that cannot be promiſed with good reaſon, do with as little reaſon bind to their obſervation. For example, If any one had promiſed to kill, to betray, to ſell his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, or any other ſuch like thing, he would not be obliged to make good his promiſe; for as much as he that promiſeth thoſe unlawful
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:96329:102"/>things, promiſeth that whereunto he neither hath nor can have any right: And a promiſe takes its ſtrength from the right which the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſer hath over the thing promiſed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>Is it not as unlawful to give an Heretique his life (which he employes in ſeducing the People) as to kill or beat another man?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Thoſe things are not of the ſame nature: A man cannot be beaten or killed without a violation of all Lawes; but by keeping faith with Heretiques none at all are infringed. All well-governed Nations have thought it juſt and neceſſary to keep their word where it was engaged. When <hi>Croton</hi> a notorious robber preſented himſelf, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> commanded that ſum to be delivered to him, which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the perſon that ſhould bring in the Bandites head: And <hi>Pompey</hi> gave Pirates both their lives and means to live quietly, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not falſifie his promiſe. But certainly there is no leſs obligation to keep faith with an Heretique, then with a High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-man, and a Free-booter; unleſs one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that a Chriſtian is leſs bound to make good his word then a Heathen; or that keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith ſhould be thought convenient among all other Nations, and inconvenient to thoſe that profeſs the Faith: as if the People that are enlightned by the brightneſs of the Goſpel, ought to be leſs juſt then thoſe that are immerſt and mudded in the darkneſs of error and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>

                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>You conclude then, that it is requiſite to keep faith even with Infidels and Heretiques; and I am of the ſame opinion. And in very truth, a Prince that ſhould have Subjects of a Religion which would teach the contrary, could have no confidence in them, no more then they in him, if he had no regard to keep his word with them, upon pretenſe that he believed them Heretiques.

                     <hi>Conſtance</hi> having ſhewn us the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of humane promiſes, hath drawn us a little out of our way; yet it is no hard matter to ſtrike into it again. <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Count Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and Elector of <hi>Collen,</hi> held the Biſhopricks of <hi>Hildeſheim, Paderborne, Verden, Munſter,</hi> and <hi>Liege,</hi> all together; by means whereof he might have given himſelf much eaſe, and enjoyed his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if the War had not engaged him in great diſquiet and exceſſive expenſes. The Jeſuits have heretofore told me, that the two firſt of theſe Biſhopricks had a miraculous foundation, after this manner; while <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debouaire</hi> was at <hi>Hildeſheim,</hi> it ſnowed ſo much all night, that on the morrow the ſnow was a foot deep every where, except in the place where the Cathedral Church was afterwards built: And <hi>Charlemagne</hi> deſiring to encamp on that ground where <hi>Paderborne</hi> ſtands, wherein there was want of water, the firſt pin that was ſtruck into the earth to faſten his Pavillion, gave iſſue
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:96329:103"/>to a plentiful ſpring that drives ſome water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mills. Upon which ſource the Emperor cauſed the Church to be built, and endowed it with a Revenue neceſſary for the maintenance of a Biſhop. <hi>Liege</hi> is known to all thoſe that have read the Hiſtory of <hi>Charles</hi> the Brave Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who lay very heavy upon it at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times, and upon ſundry occaſions. This Biſhoprick and that of <hi>Hildeſheim</hi> are ſtill in the poſſeſſion of the Elector of <hi>Collen;</hi> but <hi>Verden</hi> and <hi>Minden</hi> were Secularized.</p>

                  <p>That City is of ſpecial note, becauſe its Biſhop is the Head of the Circle of <hi>Weſtphalia,</hi> and becauſe it was the place of the Aſſembly wherein many Biſhopricks altered their proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but much more, for having been the ſeat of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leyden,</hi> that petty King, and ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Anabaptiſt, who for ſome years carried the Sceptre and Ball for marks of his Royalty: At laſt he was beſieged, taken, and put on the top of a Steeple in an iron Cage, where he was eaten up by flyes and waſps, together with two of his companions who were placed a little lower, after they had been carried in triumph and mockery unto ſeveral Princes. That puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fit for their Rebellion, and other crimes of theirs, was inflicted upon them. <hi>A. D.</hi> 1536.</p>

                  <p>The Canon Law is directly againſt plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Benefices; and according to the doctrine of the Caſuiſts, juſt as Chriſtians are forbidden to have many wives at one time, ſo are Prieſts to have many ſuch Benefices together: For where the Scripture ordains, that a Biſhop ſhould be the husband of one wife, they ſay it is meant of one Biſhoprick. But the Pope doth eaſily diſpenſe, when the Biſhop is of high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction; and at this time there are ſome great Lords that hold more then two of the beſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhopricks in <hi>Germany.</hi>

                  <p>The Knights Templers and of St. <hi>John</hi> having fought proſperouſly againſt the Infidels, raiſed an emulation in ſome German Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who waited upon the Emperor <hi>Frederick</hi> I. in his expedition to the Holy Land, to take the <hi>Croiſado;</hi> and becauſe they were inſtalled in the Church and Hoſpital of St. <hi>Mary</hi> at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> they were called <hi>Marianites.</hi> Their Order differed nothing from thoſe above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but in the form and colour of their Croſs, and was approved by Pope <hi>Celestin</hi> III.

                  <p>The piety of the ancient Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan that which the avarice of the Prieſts hath accompliſhed; and to ſpeak more clearly, Chriſtians of every condition ſeeing men of the Church afflicted, beaten, and martyred for the Goſpels ſake, gave them both in their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and left them after their deaths a part of their Eſtates, either upon money lent out for their uſe, or upon lands ſet at a perpetual rent, or upon other goods. After which, Prieſts went on even to exceſs, and by Legacies in Wills and Teſtaments got Dutchies, Counties, Baronies, Fiefs, Caſtles, Rent-charges as well as Services and Fee-farm-rents, and Houſes both in City and Countrey: by which means Succeſſions fell to them on every ſide; and ſo they purchaſed, exchanged, &amp; negotiated with the Revenue of their Benefices, employing the profits thereof to compaſs other eſtates, which being in their hands became exempt and free of all charge. It was that vaſt enriching of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which made the People ſo bare and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, being forced to contribute towards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying the expenſes of War, and the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Princes, although the poor contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors enjoyed but the leaſt part of the land;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:96329:107"/>which obliged Kings at laſt to forbid Prieſts all kinds of further acquiſitions. If that had not been done, they had ſwallowed all long ſince; for heretofore there was an order, that no Will ſhould be made without bequeathing ſomething to the Church: And if any one dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inteſtate, an eſtimate was made of his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and according to the value thereof a portion was allotted and given to the Prieſts. For the remedying of that exceſs very excellent Laws have been made in <hi>England,</hi> the Low Countreys, and at <hi>Venice;</hi> and the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelf, ſeeing the immenſe riches of the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> and <hi>Celeſtins,</hi> made orders ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly prohibiting them the acquiring of any more immovables.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe regulations are juſt, where Churchmen live in plenty; but they ſhould not be hindred from making moderate acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it being reaſonable that they who feed us ſpiritually, ſhould be maintained corporally.</p>

                  <p>Your argument is very good: Poverty ſhould not be permitted in the Church; for it is impoſſible the Prieſt ſhould carefully attend upon preaching the Goſpel, viſiting the ſick, comforting the afflicted, and adminiſtring the Sacraments, and at the ſame time labour to get bread. While Clergy-men were under continual ſuffering, they ſtood in need of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary aſſiſtance, to keep them from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into deſpair; but growing too rich, they
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:96329:108"/>were ſwallowed up in lazyneſs, from whence there flowed ſtreams of ignorance, wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, impiety, luxury, ſuperſtition, idolatry, and other vices, which brought Chriſtendom almoſt to utter ruine.</p>

                  <p>The Prelates of <hi>Germany</hi> are not all rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to their Dignity after one and the ſame manner; and the order obſerved now differs from that which was obſerved when <hi>Germany</hi> received the Faith. In the beginning of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity Biſhops were every where choſen by the Clergy and the People joyntly. After which, when the Roman Emperors were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians, they ſometimes gave Biſhops to the principal Churches by their own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or of ſeveral that were propoſed to them, they made choice of him that pleaſed them beſt: So <hi>Constans</hi> made <hi>Liberius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger choſe <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarius</hi> to be Biſhop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> from amongſt many that were named to him. Since the fourth age (before which there were few or no Biſhops in <hi>Germany</hi>) the Kings made a Decree, that no man ſhould be promoted to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:96329:108"/>the Epiſcopal Dignity without their conſent; and when <hi>Germany</hi> was united to <hi>France,</hi> the French Kings made ſuch uſe of that right, that no man was made Biſhop but by their nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or at leaſt their approbation: for if the Clergy and the People choſe a Biſhop, he was to be confirmed by the King. In <hi>Bavaria</hi> (which at that time had its own Kings) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the People, and ſometimes the King choſe the Biſhops, but ſo as there was no need to have Bulls from <hi>Rome. Pepin</hi> gave the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick of <hi>Mentz</hi> to <hi>Boniface;</hi> and that Prelate being grown old, he obtained a Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutor from the ſame King, without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the Pope.</p>

                     <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. took away from Kings and Emperors the power not only of creating and confirming the Popes, but the Biſhops alſo in the Countreys under their obedience; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving excommunicated the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> IV. he commanded <hi>Hugh</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Die</hi> his Legat in <hi>France</hi> to procure a Decree to be made againſt Lay-men that would name perſons unto Biſhopricks. The year after, he forbad Church-men the receiving of any Biſhoprick, Abbey, or other Benefice from the hand of a Lay-man, though he were King or Emperor: and within two years more he pronounced, that the power of chooſing Biſhops and Paſtors belonged to the Apoſtolick See. <hi>Victor</hi> III. confirmed the Decrees of <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> II. went further, and at the Synod of <hi>Melfi Can.</hi> 8. and at that of <hi>Clermont Can.</hi> 15. and 16. forbad Clergy-men to take the Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance unto their Princes. Thoſe Decrees drew the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> V. into the field, who took <hi>Paſchal</hi> II. priſoner, and made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the Empire unto its firſt condition. But when Popes had once taſted what a pleaſure it was to be independent, and to keep the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors under their authority, they forced the Councils of <hi>Lateran</hi> and <hi>Vienna</hi> held in the year 1112. to declare Heretical the Collations of Benefices made by Lay-men. The Emperors
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:96329:109"/>on the other ſide deſiring to keep up their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, named one Biſhop, and the Pope or the People, another; and the ſtronger party held the Biſhoprick, to the great ſcandal and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of Chriſtendom.

                  <p>There are two ways of creating Prelates in <hi>Germany;</hi> the one is called <hi>Election,</hi> and the other <hi>Poſtulation.</hi> When the Chapter being Canonically aſſembled chooſes one of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their Body to be the Head thereof, or at leaſt two thirds of the Canons give him their voices, he is made Archbiſhop or Biſhop by Election: And if the ſame Canons think it fit to raiſe unto that Dignity ſome Prince or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late that is not of their Body, they call that kind of proceeding Poſtulation.

                  <p>The derivation which you make of that word, as well Latin as Dutch, pleaſes me well; but from whence do you fetch the words <hi>Palsgrave, Markgrave, Landgrave,</hi> and <hi>Burgrave?</hi>

                  <p>The Palsgrave being the head of Juſtice in the Empire, all appeals were brought to him, and he joyntly with the Emperor decided all matters of importance. Now as every thing here below is ſubject to alteration; the abuſes committed by the Landgraves, the Marquiſſes, and even by the Counts, obliged the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors to ſend Palſgraves into ſeveral places of the Empire: and at laſt thoſe Counts Palatine craftily making uſe of the Emperors negligence, appropriated unto themſelves the Provinces of <hi>Saxony, Bavaria, Franconia,</hi> and the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate.</hi> Neither did the Margraves and Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graves continue in the ſame ſtate: For in the beginning their principal aim was the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of equity between the Subjects of the Empire; and a little after, they took upon them the care to hinder the Forain Enemy and the ſeditious inhabitant from doing wrong to thoſe that were under their juriſdiction. There are others that draw the word <hi>Margrave</hi> from <hi>Marka,</hi> which in old Dutch ſignifies a horſe; &amp; if that Etymology be allowed for true, I think the Marquiſſes were Generals of Horſe, and the Landgraves of Foot. Thoſe Lords having raiſed their Commands to ſo high a point, and the Emperor loſing his authority by little and little, from Officers they became Proprietors of the Provinces they had in charge. The reaſon
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:96329:115"/>why I think that Marquiſſes were firſt Judges, then Governors, and at laſt Princes of ſome Frontier Provinces, is becauſe the ancient Marquiſates are all upon the Borders of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, where the Emperors in former times maintained ſome Troops of Horſe to hinder the inroads of diſaffected Neighbours.</p>

<pb n="215" facs="tcp:96329:116"/>Family arrived to the higheſt degree of power and dignity, were deſirous that it ſhould have a peculiar name to it ſelf; and for that reaſon they would never communicate it to any one elſe, though they have been entreated ſo to do very often and very earneſtly. Now the word ſignifies Prince or chief of Dukes, as that of Archbiſhop ſignifies Prince or chief of Biſhops: But I do not ſee that the Archdukes have any Suffragan Dukes, as the Archbiſhops, who have Biſhops under them.</p>

                  <p>The title of Duke is very ancient, but it hath not alwayes been ſo conſiderable as it is now. The Romans honoured their chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of war with that name, becauſe they led on the ſouldiers to the battel. After that, and in proceſs of time, the ſtate of affairs obliging the Emperors to have Officers of quality and long experience in war to guard the Frontier Provinces, they ſent ſome of their Dukes thither.</p>

                  <p>The Emperors did not appoint Dukes only for the Government of Frontier provinces, ſeeing thoſe that ly in the midſt of the Empire, are honoured alſo with the title of Dukedom.</p>

                  <p>The firſt Governor that bore the quality of Duke was he of the Marches of <hi>Rhetia,</hi> a Countrey betwixt <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> which at this time we call the <hi>Griſons.</hi> To that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Emperors ſent a Duke to withſtand the <hi>Germans,</hi> who oftentimes endeavoured to make irruptions into <hi>Italy</hi> through that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, ſince which, ſeveral Governors as well of other Provinces in the Empire as thoſe on the Borders, have had the ſame honour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was thought neceſſary to ſend garriſons into thoſe parts, to keep the People in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and alſo by that means to provide an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable entertainment for thoſe Lords that had ſerved well in the wars. But as nothing is enough for ambition, thoſe Governors in the end made themſelves maſters of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces which they had in charge: And ſo the Dukes grew great by the diminution and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebling of their Head, as the Marquiſſes, Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graves, Burgraves, and Counts in like manner did. The word <hi>Duke</hi> is borrowed from the Latin <hi>Ducere,</hi> as <hi>Hertzog</hi> in Dutch from words that ſignify a Conductor of an Army.</p>

                  <p>We have ſeen already that the ancients called them <hi>Duces</hi> that led on ſouldiers to the battel, and <hi>Comites</hi> thoſe that were taken out of the Emperors Court to adminiſter Juſtice to the Subjects of the Empire. A little after, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe employments were altered, and the Dukes became Generals of Armies, or Governors of Provinces; and the Counts, chief Juſtices in the Cities and Provinces of the Empire: And both of them made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the lands whereof they were Judges or Governors. All thoſe Lords aſſiſted the Emperor in the beginning, ſome at the Councel-board, and others in the field, all of them performing uſeful and beneficial ſervice to the State: Nay, I believe, without regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the title either of Duke or Count, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors employed thoſe Lords indifferently in the Palace or in the Armies; ſo that it is hard
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:96329:118"/>to judge whether title was the more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Yet it is to be obſerved, that there were ſome Counts by Office, and others by Dignity; that the former ſort were raiſed to places of authority without regard had to their birth, and the others were equal, or very little inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to the Dukes.</p>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:96329:118"/>others they added Duke as the more eminent.</p>

                  <p>You will confeſs that the ſons and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of Kings, and the greateſt Officers of the Imperial and Royal Houſes have anciently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves with the title of Count; and if the Ducal dignity had been greater, they would without queſtion have deſired, ſought for, and obtained it.</p>

                  <p>The titles which Kings have formerly given to their children, as alſo thoſe of Count of the Palace, <hi>Comes Stabuli</hi> or Conſtable, and others which ſatisfied the principal Officers of the Imperial Court, do in no wiſe derogate from the quality of Duke: For at laſt thoſe Princes better bethought themſelves, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging that the name of Duke was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes a higher quality then that of Count, they deſired to be honoured with the ſame. I know very well, that the Counties of <hi>Caſtille, Portugal, Flanders, Tyrol, Tolouſe, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi> and <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> were very illuſtrious; but I know alſo that the Countreys of <hi>Burgun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, Bavaria,</hi> and <hi>Lorraine,</hi> did anciently bear ſometimes the title of Kingdom, ſometimes of Dukedom, and that the latter imported no leſs authority then the other. The Princes of <hi>Poland, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Bohemia,</hi> who are at this time great Kings, did for many ages bear no more then the quality of Duke: Nay, ſome Provinces in <hi>Spain</hi> were governed by Dukes a thouſand years before the birth of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:96329:119"/>Chriſt; and when that Countrey was aſſaulted by the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> and afterwards by the <hi>Romans,</hi> it was vigorouſly defended by the ſame Dukes, who were Soverain and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. From whence you may judge, that the title of Duke was almoſt equal to that of King, before ever there were any Counts; and ſo conclude, that albeit in certain Countreys and times the title of Duke hath been ſomewhat abaſed, yet it was never inferior to that of Count, but alwayes greater.</p>

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:96329:119"/>ſhould have under him four Kingdoms, a King four Dutchies, a Duke four Counties, a Count four Baronies, a Baron four Caſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and a Caſtellan four Fiefs. Thoſe maxims of Quaternions ſhould be expelled out of your thoughts as ridiculous: Otherwiſe all they that have four Kingdoms would be Emperors; and the Emperor loſing one of thoſe four which he had, would ceaſe to be Emperor. Beſides all Kingdoms are not equal; and it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a great many ſuch Kingdoms as <hi>Valencia, Murcia, Grenada, Algarvia, Majorca, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norca, Ivica,</hi> and <hi>Yuetot,</hi> to make one great King. And on the other ſide, if any one could have three Kingdoms equal to that of <hi>France</hi> in richneſs of ſoil, abundance of People, and number of Nobility, he might equalize the greateſt Emperors; and the Count of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,</hi> to whom ſeven other Counts did ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, would almoſt double the proportion of a Duke.</p>

                     <hi>Stephanus Paſchalis,</hi> a famous ſearcher
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:96329:120"/>of Antiquity, ſaith there were as many, nay more Counts then Cities in <hi>Gaule,</hi> when the French made themſelves maſters of it; and that the Conquerors deſiring to uſe their new Kingdom favourably, and give a ſubdued Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple no cauſe of complaint, kept up all the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and commands which the Romans had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced amongſt them. The Laws of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne</hi> and of his ſon <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonaire</hi> are full of the order which the Counts were to obſerve in the adminiſtration of juſtice. From whence you may gather, that the Counts of thoſe times were not raiſed to ſuch a height of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as they are now.</p>

                  <p>If the Counts were but Judges, who uſually are ſuch no longer then their Prince pleaſeth; how came it to paſs that they made themſelves maſters of the lands which were under their Juriſdiction?</p>

                  <p>Though the Emperors had power to deprive the Counts of their Offices, yet for the moſt part they let them. enjoy them during their lives; and if they had any ſons capable to ſucceed them, they were preferred before any other: And that they might be the better enabled to attend upon the adminiſtration of Juſtice, and defend the People when need ſhould require, the Emperors granted them Fiefs within the Territory of their Juriſdiction, which Fiefs gave them opportunity to make themſelves Maſters of all the reſt, and to tranſmit the ſame unto their heirs.</p>

                  <p>It is hard to ſay under what Emperor that remarkable change hapned in the Empire; but it is probable that it was under the Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants of <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> in the time when <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald and his ſon <hi>Lewis</hi> the Stammerer made their reſidence in <hi>France,</hi> and were at variance with the ſons of <hi>Lewis Germanicus</hi> their kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who ſaid the Imperial dignity belonged to them.</p>

                  <p>I do not believe it is your deſire to know what Rents, Fortreſſes, Cities, or Subjects every Count hath; much leſs, what they might be able to do all together: For it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for me to anſwer you. Imagining then that you only ask, what place they have in the Aſſemblies, and after what manner they give their ſuffrages there, I anſwer, that they ſit immediately next after the Princes, and that they have two voices, one for the Bench of <hi>Wetteravia,</hi> the other for that of <hi>Swaben.</hi> For the reſt, in their particular Meetings every one hath his voice, and being agreed, they make choice of one out of their Body to carry their opinion unto the Colledge of the Princes.</p>

                  <p>To provide a ſatisfactory anſwer to your
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:96329:121"/>queſtion, you muſt know, there be three ſorts of Counts in <hi>Germany,</hi> not compriſing thoſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> The firſt are Eſtates of the Empire, as well in regard of their perſons, as of their Fiefs; the ſecond having one or more Lands holding immediately of the Empire, and by reaſon thereof being Eſtates of the Empire, do alſo hold a Fief of ſome particular Prince, in regard whereof they are his Subjects, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to do him ſome ſervice: The third ſort have no Fief holding immediately of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and conſequently no place in the Diets.

                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>All the Immediate Counts of the Empire are like ſo many little Kings, and pay but very few acknowledgements to the Emperor. Many of them coyn money, and exerciſe other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galities, whereby they draw near to the rank and condition of Princes; and for that cauſe the very Electors are not thought to marry be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low themſelves when they take ſuch Counteſſes to be their Wives: I do not know whether it be ſo or no when they take others.</p>

                  <p>It is certain that the Electors have marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Immediate Counteſſes; and I think they might have married others without wronging their poſterity.

                  <p>I will tell you what I know; but that will be no great matter. The Counts of <hi>Barby</hi> are allied to the Dukes of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> and to the Princes of <hi>Anhalt</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-Friſeland;</hi> they uſe the title of Noble Lords. Thoſe of <hi>Caſtel</hi> are as ancient as the Empire in <hi>Germany;</hi> they are of the chiefeſt perſons of <hi>Franconia,</hi> fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in vertue, great in merit, happy in alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſoverain in their Juſtice, and might raiſe envy in many, though they had none but <hi>Wolf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gang George,</hi> Preſident of the Councel of State, and great Steward of the Court of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> a moſt excellent pattern of piety, juſtice, and integrity. The Counts of <hi>Oldenbourg</hi> and of <hi>Delmenhorſt</hi> are totally extinguiſhed by the death of <hi>Antony Gunther,</hi> who having made his name known amongſt all the greateſt Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſecured his lands by the great number of Horſes which he gave away, to ſave himſelf from loſing 1200. breeding Mares which he
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:96329:126"/>had in his grounds, dyed without children lawfully begotten in the year 1656. at leaſt, if I may believe the <hi>Gazette,</hi> where I read it, though ſome men do not agree to it. The King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited his Counties; <hi>Iohn</hi> Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> the Lordſhip of <hi>Iever;</hi> and <hi>Antony</hi> Count of <hi>Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg</hi> his natural ſon, all the reſt of his lands. Thoſe of <hi>Erbach</hi> find their original in the affection which a daughter of <hi>Charlemagnes</hi> bore to a Gentleman in her Fathers Court, who being recommended by his own merit, as much as he was favoured by the generoſity of <hi>Charles,</hi> had the honour to marry her, after he had had that of being carried upon her back through the Court of the Palace. The Counts of <hi>Hanau</hi> have as large an eſtate as a great Prince, and in that a Juſtice from which their Subjects cannot appeal: And having often both given and taken daughters to and from the beſt Houſes of the Empire, they have been ſo happy as to ſee a noble Lady of their family ſteer the State of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> and bring it ſuccesful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Port during the moſt dreadful ſtorm that ever blew upon the Empire for many ages.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe of which I ſay nothing, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to me. The Counts of <hi>Helfenstein,</hi> having flouriſhed above a thouſand years, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired ſome years ſince. Thoſe of <hi>Leininguen</hi> judge their Subjects cauſes without any Appeal.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:96329:126"/>The Houſe of <hi>Hohenlohe</hi> would be very migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if it had not divided its lands into many portions: The Lords thereof are naturally Souldiers, brave, well made both in body and mind, and glorious as well through their own merit, as for that of their Anceſtors. The Barons of <hi>Limbourg,</hi> whom all Writers place amongſt the Counts, have a title of <hi>Semperfrey,</hi> always free, that no body bears but they: They are ſo ancient, that they know not their own beginning; and ſo well known in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> that their priviledge of being Vicars to the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> Great Cup-bearer of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, is obvious to every one. They of <hi>Manſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld</hi> are of different Religions: One of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques is Governor of <hi>Raab</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> the other is Maſter of the Horſe to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror: Of the <hi>Lutherans, Iohn George</hi> is travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to enable himſelf to anſwer the hopes which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This County is plentiful in Copper and other Minerals, and famous for many things, but eſpecially for <hi>Eiſeliben</hi> where Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> was born in the year 1484. and dyed there 63. years after. The Counts of <hi>Montfort</hi> have nothing common with thoſe in <hi>France,</hi> but the name; they are certainly very noble, very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and very vertuous.</p>

                  <p>I ſpeak of the Counts in an Alphabetical method, not always ſuitable to their merit; otherwiſe many ſhould have come behind thoſe Houſes ſo abounding in extraordinary perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages. That of <hi>Ottinguen</hi> is divided into two principal Branches: That of <hi>Waldenſtein</hi> is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique, that of <hi>Ottinguen</hi> Lutheran, and both perfectly well allied; but ſpecially <hi>Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chim Erneſt,</hi> who having already had one Counteſs of <hi>Solmes,</hi> and another of <hi>Hehenlobe,</hi> is in the laſt place married to a Princeſs Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine; and had of the two former, beſides many ſweet children, <hi>Sophia Margaret,</hi> and <hi>Mary Dorothy Sophia,</hi> Princeſſes whoſe graces and endowments of body and mind have acquired, to the firſt the chaſt love and conjugal bed of <hi>Albert</hi> Marquiſs of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> of <hi>Anſpach;</hi> to the ſecond, that of <hi>Eberhard</hi> Duke of <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg;</hi> and to the Father, two Sons-in-law equal in Grandeur, piety, and magnificence. The <hi>Rhingraves</hi> have furniſhed matter to ſo many Hiſtories ancient and modern, that no body is a ſtranger to their vertue, nobility, and generoſity. The Counts of <hi>Schwartzbourg</hi> are great in riches, vertue and alliances: When I paſſed through their Countrey, <hi>Clara</hi> Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> and <hi>Sophia Agnes</hi> Princeſs of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> were widows to two Lords of that Houſe; and <hi>Antony Gunther</hi> had a Princeſs Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine. Many believe the Counts of <hi>Solmes</hi> are iſſued out of thoſe of <hi>Naſſau:</hi> They are not
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:96329:127"/>rich, but you will meet with few Lords ſo well allyed. <hi>Frederick Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> the honour of the Captains of our age, had the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous <hi>Amelia; Joachim Ernest</hi> Marquis of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> had the Phenix of beauty and chaſtity, <hi>Sophia; Frederick</hi> Marquis of <hi>Dour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach,</hi> the incomparable <hi>Eleonor; Auguſtus</hi> Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> the pious <hi>Sibyll; <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lrick</hi> Duke of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> the amiable <hi>Sophia Doro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; Maurice</hi> Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> the fair <hi>Agnes;</hi> and <hi>Ernest</hi> his ſon hath at this time <hi>Mary Eleonor,</hi> all Counteſſes of <hi>Solmes.</hi> From whence we may conclude, that this Houſe is fruitful in beautiful and vertuous Ladies.</p>

                  <p>The Counts of <hi>Salme</hi> were raiſed to the rank of Princes, though their lands be held of the Duke of <hi>Lorraine:</hi> They are <hi>Rhingraves,</hi> and all the <hi>Rhingraves</hi> bear the name and Arms of <hi>Salme.</hi> They of <hi>Stolberg</hi> are inferior to none either in antiquity of Nobility, or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Alliances, or priviledges: They coyn money both of gold and ſilver, and bear for their Arms a Stag Sable, becauſe one of the ancient Counts of that Houſe giving an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of hunting to the Emperor <hi>Conrade</hi> of <hi>Franconia,</hi> a black Stag was taken, and the Emperor would tranſmit the memory
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:96329:128"/>thereof to poſterity by that change of Arms. As to the Barons, you ought to know that they who are Eſtates of the Empire, do hardly differ from the Counts but in name: In all things elſe they are equal; they marry their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they are in the ſame Claſſe at the Diets of the Empire, they give their Suffrages there after the ſame manner, and enjoy the ſame immunities; laſtly they are both alike ſtyled Illuſtrious.</p>

                  <p>There are but few Barons of the Empire: To be ſuch an one, it is neceſſary to be Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated, and contribute to the neceſſities of the State; which belongs not to any one of thoſe whom the Emperor creates upon a new ſcore in his hereditary Countreys, how rich and potent ſoever they be: And for that cauſe they have neither voice nor place in the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the Empire. Many of the ancient Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons have taken the quality of Count; thoſe which remain are <hi>Creange, Fleckenſtein, Fugger, Hohengeroldſeck, Konigſeck, Limbourg, Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elrein, Perleſtein, Plaven, Rapolſtein, Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, Scheuk</hi> of <hi>Tautemberg, Wolfenſtein, Winemberg, Walbot,</hi> and it may be ſome others that are not come to my knowledge. Part of thoſe of <hi>Creange</hi> are Counts; but the others are not inferior to them, being allyed even to Princes, and very near to the Houſes
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:96329:128"/>of <hi>Naſſau</hi> and the <hi>Rhingraves:</hi> They of <hi>Fleck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enſtein</hi> have ſignalized themſelves in the laſt War, where they got honour, and ſerved in the quality of Generals: The <hi>Fuggers</hi> are not very ancient, but remarkable for vertue, and for their priviledge of Soverain Juſtice upon their Lands. The Barons or Counts of <hi>Rapol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein,</hi> who are otherwiſe called <hi>Ribaupierre,</hi> were Dukes of <hi>Spoleto;</hi> and having lived many ages with ſplendor, and appeared at ſeveral Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, are now reduced to <hi>John Iames,</hi> to whom I wiſh iſſue male, for the preſervation of his illuſtrious Houſe, which will otherwiſe end in him.

                  <p>It is ſomething to be Baron of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in regard of the place they have in the Aſſemblies; otherwiſe I think there is but little difference between one Baron and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>

                  <p>They that bear the ſame title, are not alwayes of the ſame condition: One who hath been declared Doctor in an Univerſity where no man is received but he that hath given proof of his learning, is to be preferred before him who hath gotten Letters in another Univerſity for a piece of money. And ſo it is in this matter: They that are Barons by merit, and are allyed to great Families for many generations, are and ought to be preferred before thoſe that have not the like advantages. Otherwiſe, I do not think that for having place in the Diets one is

                  <p>I think it was derived from the Latin <hi>Vir;</hi> for as <hi>Baron</hi> ſignifies a perſonage illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for virtue and birth, ſo alſo the Latin word <hi>Vir</hi> ſignifies a man ſeparate and diſtinct from the vulgar by his <hi>Virtue.</hi> Now this title hath been diverſly taken according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of times and places. By the <hi>Barons</hi> were anciently underſtood in <hi>France</hi> all the Subjects that held immediately of the King; and ſo the word comprehended Dukes, Counts, and other Lords indifferently.

                  <p>TO ſee the title of this Dialogue, one would judge that you put a difference between the Knight and the Gentleman; and yet throughout all <hi>Germany</hi> the Nobility goes under the name of Knighthood, and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen writing in Latin ſtyle themſelves <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> that is, Knights.</p>

                  <p>Though German Gentlemen be called <hi>Equites</hi> in Latin, yet it is certain there is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Knight and the Gentleman: For firſt, the Knight hath been alwayes more priviledged then the Gentleman: 2. The chance of birth makes the Gentleman, without his contributing any thing to it; but worth and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:96329:130"/>valour raiſes the Knight to that degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. 3. Princes and Lords do not ſeek for the title of a Gentleman, as they do very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for that of a Knight. And 4. the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is born ſo, the Knight comes to be ſo, that is, a Gentleman begets a Gentleman, but a Knight begets not a Knight.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>I have heard ſay, that the ſons of great Princes are Knights from their cradle; which if it be ſo, it may be ſaid, that a Knight begets a Knight.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>I know the French ſay that the ſons of their Kings are Knights in the very moment of their birth: Nevertheleſs <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. received the Order of Knighthood by the hand of <hi>Philip</hi> Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> the day of his Inauguration the 16. <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1461. <hi>Francis</hi> I. before the Bettel of <hi>Marignan September</hi> 17. 1515. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſame honour from <hi>Peter Bayard</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Dauphine,</hi> who for his valour was ſurnamed <hi>the Knight without reproach.</hi> And when <hi>William</hi> Count of <hi>Holland</hi> was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he would be created Knight before he received the Crown. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears, that ſome great Princes thought they were not born Knights: And though I ſhould allow that the ſons of Kings are ſo from their Cradle, it is certain that others are not ſo, ſeeing Princes themſelves do not aſſume that quality, if they have not ſolemnly received that honour.</p>
               </sp>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>I know that commonly they that are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Knights, are aſſociated into ſome Order Regular or Secular; but I do not know the difference between thoſe Orders.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>The Regular Orders have been approved by the Pope under ſome Rule, and the Secular have been inſtituted by ſome other Prince. The former oblige their Knights to the vows of poverty, chaſtity, and obedience; the other, only to endeavour and procure the honour and advantage of the Head of their Order. Now as men are received into the number of Knights for their merit, or for the hope which he that beſtows that honour hath, that the perſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted will do worthy actions; ſo a Knight forfeits and becomes deprived of the ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for the enormous crimes he commits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expectation of him that received him into the Fellowſhip of the Order.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>All Knights are not received after the ſame manner, nor degraded for the ſame of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Into the greateſt part of Regular Orders they admit Gentlemen that have attained to the age of 18. years, and conſequently before they have given any proof of their merit; and they are degraded for murders baſely committed by lying in ambuſh, or other crimes unworthy of ſuch perſons: But Kings admit none into their Orders but thoſe that have performed good and conſiderable ſervices, and for that cauſe
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:96329:131"/>a man is oftentimes well in years before he can obtain that honour; of which alſo he cannot be deprived but for High Treaſon Divine or Humane, or for notorious cowardize, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving run away from his Colours, and forſaken his Chief.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>If it be ſo, there is leſs honour in being admitted into a Regular then into a Secular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>I do really think ſo; becauſe for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the latter, it is requiſite that a man joyn his own vertue unto that of his Anceſtors: And the Order which makes him that is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into it Companion of a Soverain, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with his King, hath doubtleſs ſomething more eminent in it, then that which only makes him brother and Companion of certain Gentlemen.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>I would willingly know why ſo many Orders of Knighthood have been inſtituted.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Neceſſity was the firſt and principal cauſe of all thoſe Orders. The Regulars began after <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Boullion</hi> had taken <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> when ſome valiant Gentlemen having voluntarily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken the defence of the oppreſſed, the maintenance of Hoſpitals, the care of Pilgrims, and the ſecuring of the ways, Popes gave them priviledges, and beſtowed honours upon them, to draw on others to the ſame profeſſion: Which is honourable to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well for the zeal which Catholiques ſhow in
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:96329:132"/>viſiting the Holy places, as becauſe all the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility alſo that embraces a Rule, becomes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Pope.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>Had Kings the ſame deſign?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Conquerors made Souldiers willing to follow them, by ſharing the fruit of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts with them; and when their Succeſſors had not eſtate enough to reward all the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions and eminent ſervices which Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men did for them, being perſwaded that a man of courage values nothing comparably to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, which diſtinguiſh him from other men, they invented thoſe Orders, which without exhauſting their Treaſure would gain them the Flower of their Subjects, and enflame all others with an extreme deſire to make themſelves worthy of the ſame honour. I think it was for that reaſon, that anciently they created Knights juſt before the Battel, to make them engage more reſolutely; or preſently after it, to recompenſe thoſe that had the greateſt hand in the victory.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>I would know whether there be many Knights in <hi>Germany.</hi>

                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>There be Knights of four ſorts, who ought to be Princes, Lords or Gentlemen. The Emperor dubs ſome by touching them lightly upon the ſhoulder with a naked ſword, and ſaying to them, <hi>Eſto miles Dei &amp; Sancti Stephani,</hi> Be a Souldier of God and of St. <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen;</hi> and thoſe wear no Collar, or other
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:96329:132"/>mark to diſtinguiſh them from other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The Kings of <hi>Spain, England,</hi> and <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> do alſo ſend their Order to ſuch Lords as they ſet moſt value upon: The firſt wear the Golden Fleece, the ſecond the Garter, and the third the Elephant enamelled with white, and enchaſed with a Croſs of five great Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds. All the other Knights are of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Orders of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> or <hi>Malta:</hi> The form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er have the Black Croſs, and are named <hi>Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniques;</hi> the latter wear a white one, and are called Knights Hoſpitallers of St. <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> Heretofore all of the laſt Order were Catholiques, but there are ſome of them now that are not ſo, and poſſeſs the Commanderies which the Proteſtant Princes have not incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into their Demeſnes. But if you happen to ſee any German, Suiſſe, or Hollander wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Collar of the Order of St. <hi>Michael,</hi> you may take notice that the moſt Chriſtian King ſometimes confers the honour of that Order upon thoſe that have done him ſome acceptable ſervice.</p>

                  <p>Do all Emperors and Kings of the Romans make Knights?</p>

                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>If they do not, at leaſt they may all do ſo: And at the Coronation of <hi>Charles</hi> V. there was ſuch an abuſe, that all thoſe that would have that honour, received it, although they were not Gentlemen. In our days it hath not been ſo abuſed: For when the laſt
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:96329:133"/>
                     <hi>Ferdinand</hi> was crowned at <hi>Ratisbon,</hi> he created 28. Knights, the greateſt part of them very il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious both by their birth and merit.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>Now I ſee what difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Knight and a Cavalier: I pray diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſomething of the Nobility.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>There are Countreys in <hi>Europe,</hi> where the Nobility is diſtinguiſhed into Princes, Lords, and Gentlemen; who all together make one part of the State, and are the Kings right arm, the ſupport of his Crown, and the prop of his authority. It is not ſo in <hi>Germany;</hi> where the Princes, nay the pooreſt Lords would take it for an affront to be called Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: Who, as we have ſeen before, are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely ſeparated from the Body of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and have their intereſt apart.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>I know already that the Princes are Eſtates of the Empire, and have no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Nobility: But I would willingly know whether all the Gentlemen of <hi>Germany</hi> make one Body, whether they be equal in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, and whether they mutually aſſiſt one another in their neceſſities.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>The Nobility of <hi>Germany</hi> is of two ſorts: One Immediate, acknowledging none but the Emperor; the other Mediate, that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges the Emperor as Head of the Empire, yet without being exempt from the juriſdiction of another Prince. This latter hath not ſo much liberty as the former, but is for all that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:96329:133"/>in its degree, there being never a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in <hi>Germany</hi> that doth not prefer a poor Gentlewoman before a rich Burgers daughter, and wonders at the mixture of different quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties uſed in other places. But this Body being united only by the ligaments of name and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, there is little or no help to be expected from one to another.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>Is the Nobility that depends upon Princes equally priviledged through all the Empire?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Nobility being a quality acquired by vertuous actions and eminent ſervices which ſome Houſes have performed to the Prince and State, it is impoſſible but that there ſhould be ſome Houſes more Noble and better priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then others: And although fortune ſhould have more influence then merit upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing of thoſe qualities, yet the ſame judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were ſtill to be made; becauſe Soverains are ſubject to their paſſions, rewarding more bountifully, and raiſing higher ſome of their ſervants then others. It happens alſo that one Prince hath occaſion to make uſe of his Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty more often then another; and receiving more conſiderable ſervices from them, he doth alſo recompenſe them with greater and more ſignal benefits.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>There is no doubt but merit or favour hath made the difference which is found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thoſe Houſes that hold in Fee of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Prince: But I am perſwaded that all the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:96329:134"/>Nobility immediately ſubject to the Empire is equal.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>I fear your opinion is not right. Many Houſes of the immediate Gentlemen are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the firſt Noble perſonages that accompanied <hi>Henry</hi> the Fowler to the War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Huns,</hi> nay that followed <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne</hi> to the Conqueſt of <hi>Auſtria, Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Saxony:</hi> And many others coming from other places have been admitted into that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, being Gentlemen acquainted and habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in thoſe parts: Laſtly, ſome have been priviledged by the Emperors, and by vertue of their Letters are Matriculated amongſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Gentlemen. Thoſe do all enjoy the ſame priviledges in appearance, but not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality: For although theſe laſt have right of Seſſion amongſt the other Gentlemen, yet they have it not in the Chapters, out of which the Electors of <hi>Mentz, Trier,</hi> and <hi>Collen</hi> are made; no, nor in thoſe from whence Biſhops and Prelates are taken: Becauſe to have place in thoſe Chapters, it is neceſſary to prove two and thirty Coats of Nobility by Father and Mother, againſt which the moſt ſevere Critique can make no exception; which is impoſſible for new-comers, neither indeed dare they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, knowing there is ſuch difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Gentlemen.</p>

                  <p>That Nobility is cheriſhed under the ſpecial favour and protection of the Emperor, not only for the ſervices they do him (being always forward and ready to advance the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of the Empire, the glory of the Emperor, and the honour of his Crown) but alſo for the conſiderable preſents they make him when his neceſſities require. The Emperor on his part doth willingly interpoſe his care to ſee that no body oppreſs his Nobility, becauſe he is glad to have a ſure and confident party within thoſe Circles, that acknowledges their liberty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the preſervation of his Majeſty. As to what concerns that Nobility in general; the deſire of freedom, the common intereſt, the ambition which they obſerve in ſome potent
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:96329:135"/>men, and experience which teaches all men that united force is the ſtrongeſt, demonſtrate to the Gentlemen that they are better able to defend themſelves all together then ſingle; which holds them in unity, and diſpoſes them mutually to lend their hands, their heads, and their purſes to one another.</p>

                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>The Immediate Nobility being thus one Body, doth it chooſe a Head to take care of all the Members in general, and of every one in particular?</p>

                  <p>Thoſe Gentlemen have made among themſelves a kind of Ariſtocratical Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; and having divided the Circle of <hi>Swa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben</hi> into five parts, that of <hi>Franconia</hi> into ſix, and that of the <hi>Rhine</hi> into three, they have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto every part a Head, whom they call Director in <hi>Swaben</hi> and the Lower <hi>Alſatia,</hi> and Captain of the Nobility in <hi>Franconia</hi> and upon the <hi>Rhine.</hi> This Head doth nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but by the advice of two or three other choſen Gentlemen (who are given him for aids, and counſel) and of one Doctor to help them when there is occaſion to expound the Laws. He decides differences, prevents Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits, takes up quarrels, and keeps a vigilant eye upon the preſervation of the priviledges and franchiſes of all the Body. Now if any Gentleman in particular be wronged, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector takes his part, and ſupports him with the forces of all his Quarter; and if he be not

                  <p>The Quarters of the Nobility do uſually meet together once a year; and beſides the publick affairs which are debated in thoſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, they do alſo judge the differences there that happen between the Gentlemen. And when they have judged a thing reaſonable, they entreat the parties to acquieſce therein, and ſo doing to comply with their duty, and prevent Law-ſuits, which nouriſh miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and hatred between thoſe that ſhould love one another, and which might give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to thoſe that look upon the flouriſhing No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility with an evil eye, to contemn and deſpiſe it. If one of the parties think himſelf wronged, he prayes the Court of the Nobility that they would be pleaſed once more to conſider his right and his reaſons: Wherein they gratifie him, and when that is done, the parties are again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to agree; but then if they refuſe to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Judgement, they are permitted one to convent the other before the Imperial Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>

                  <p>The Franchiſes and priviledges of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Empire are great, and in ſo great number, that it would require a volume to lay them all down in writing. Thoſe which I value the moſt are, that every well-bred Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman may pretend to become Elector or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle ſiaſtical Prince, if his Religion do not ſtand in his way; for the Electors of <hi>Mentz, Trier,</hi> and <hi>Collen,</hi> and the Biſhops of <hi>Bamberg,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:96329:137"/>Wirsbourg, Spire, Wormes, Conſtance, Augs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> and <hi>Eichſtet,</hi> are ordinarily choſen out of this Body. Every Gentleman is as free upon his own lands as the Chiefeſt Lord in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; no man beſides himſelf can impoſe upon his Subjects; there are many Chapters and Nunneries, and other Church preferments, which cannot fall but into the hands of the Nobility: And, which ſurpaſſes all the reſt, he that touches one Gentleman, touches them all; and the Emperors are ſtill ready to favour and ſupport them, thereby to gratifie the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, and have them alwayes at their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>Seeing it is neceſſary to make proof of two and thirty Coats of true Nobility, it is certain that new Gentlemen cannot have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance: But do you think that Patricians of Cities ſhould be permitted to enjoy that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and that great Princes ſhould honour thoſe actions with their perſons?</p>

                  <p>Thoſe ſports being not alwayes free from emulation and jealouſie, becauſe every one deſired to make a better appearance there then his fellow, it hapned at the three and twentieth Turnament, which was held at <hi>Darmſtadt</hi> in the year 1403. that the Gentlemen of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conia</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Heſſe</hi> drew ſo much blood upon one another, that there remained dead upon the place ſeventeen of the former, and nine of the latter.

                  <p>They confined the number of parties allowed to appear, for fear it might otherwiſe grow too great; and to avoid the confuſion which would ariſe from too many Maſters and Servants: For that cauſe, and in regard every mans charges were born there, beſides that they would admit no new Nobility, no Baſtard, no Uſurer, none guilty of High Treaſon, no Oppreſſor of Widows and Orphans, none born of Parents whereof one was of baſe extraction and ignoble, no Heretique, Murderer, Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, no Coward that had run away from the Battel, nor indiſcreet perſon that had given offence to Ladies by word or deed; they did alſo refuſe to admit more then one of the ſame Family at a time.

Theſe Cities being rich and potent, make bad uſe of their power, endeavouring to ſhake off the yoke of obedience which they owe to their Maſters, to whom they give very little reſpect, but try their uttermoſt to make themſelves Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Cities.

<pb n="265" facs="tcp:96329:141"/>if he had ſeen <hi>Germany,</hi> and been forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in his heart (though according to the Spaniſh vapours he would not have expreſt it with his mouth) that there is nothing in <hi>Spain</hi> equal to <hi>Antwerp, Amsterdam, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, Collen, Nuremberg, Strasbourg, Erfort,</hi> and <hi>Augsbourg.</hi>

                  <p>If the Cities of <hi>Germany</hi> excell all others in beauty, then they are inferior to them in nothing; for <hi>Bocalini</hi> eſteems them without compariſon richer then thoſe in other places, when he ſaith that <hi>Laurence de Medicis</hi> going about to weigh them, the balance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had already weighed all the Eſtates of Chriſtendom, broke, not being able to bear ſo great a burthen. But I ſuppoſe the houſes of Great men are not ſo embelliſhed in <hi>Germany</hi> as in Forain Countreys.</p>

                  <p>I pray, be of another mind; for when you have ſeen all <hi>Europe,</hi> you will confeſs that the Cities and Caſtles where the Princes and Prelates of <hi>Germany</hi> make their reſidence, are ſo ſtately in buildings, ſo delicious in gardens, ſo artificial in Grots, ſo abounding in Fountains, flowers, fruits, and even Orange-trees, that there is nothing comparable to be ſeen elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. The Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> is lodged at <hi>Munchen</hi> in the faireſt Palace of <hi>Europe;</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Saltsbourg</hi> hath no reaſon to wiſh for thoſe at <hi>Rome;</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg</hi> hath ſeen nothing more recreative then
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:96329:142"/>his own Gardens; <hi>Heidelberg</hi> hath one of the proudeſt buildings, <hi>Stutgardt</hi> one of the moſt commodious, <hi>Caſſel</hi> one of the moſt regular, <hi>Wirsbourg</hi> one of the ſtrongeſt, and <hi>Plone</hi> one of the moſt delightful that can be ſeen. <hi>Wolfen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottel</hi> is a true ſeat for a Prince, <hi>Berlin</hi> for a King, <hi>Dreſden</hi> for an Emperor, and <hi>Munchen</hi> for a God on earth. <hi>Weymar, Gotta, Gottorf, Cel, Baden, Auſpach, Dourlach,</hi> and <hi>Echinguen,</hi> are very little inferior to the faireſt in <hi>Europe.</hi>

                  <p>I do not think you require a Catalogue of the Imperial Cities: Nevertheleſs if you have ſuch a deſire, you ſhall find them here, of every one whereof I ſhall ſay ſomething in an Alphabetical order. <hi>Aix,</hi> which the Latins call <hi>Aquisgranum,</hi> from the hot and holeſome Baths that <hi>Granus</hi> brother to the Emperor <hi>Nero</hi> found there, is the place where <hi>De Serres</hi> ſaith that <hi>Charlemagne</hi> was born, and where all Hiſtorians agree that he lyes buried. Many ſay, that Heroical perſon made this City the Metropolis of the Empire on this ſide the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and it may be for that reaſon it is ſtyled <hi>the Royal City.</hi> The Golden Bull ordains that the Emperor receive the firſt Crown there; and if he take that honour in another place, they bring the Royal ornaments from thence, with
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:96329:142"/>the <hi>Perſian</hi> ſword which Great <hi>Charles</hi> wore by his ſide, and with which the Emperor cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates Knights.</p>

                  <p>I believe the Emperor <hi>Charlemagne</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged that City ſo much, becauſe it ſtands in a place from whence he might commodiouſly look after the Government of both his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi>

There are two and twenty Tribes, which have every one an Eſchevin or Alderman, out of whom they chooſe the Conſul whom they call <hi>Ammeiſter,</hi> who joyntly with the Aldermen elects Ten Gentlemen of the City to be Senators, and all together make up the Senat. They take four of thoſe Ten Gentlemen to be <hi>Statmeiſters</hi> or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who at debates ask the voices, firſt of the Conſul, and then of the other Senators. The Office of the Conſul is annual, and cannot be poſſeſſed by any Gentleman; that of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen is for two years. The Senat conſiſting of thirteen, and the Councel of fifteen, are
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:96329:143"/>perpetual. The firſt treats of Confederations and Military affairs, the latter hath power to exhort the Conſul, if he fail in his duty. The Arſenal of this City is provided with ſo great a quantity of all ſorts of Canon, Pikes, Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets, Halberds, Partiſans, Swords, Bucklers, Piſtols, Head-pieces, Back and-breſts, Gant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, Vambraces, and other Arms as well of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive as defenſive, that there be few of the like to be ſeen any where elſe.</p>

There is a Caſtle near it, the Lords whereof are called Burgraves. <hi>Guemunde,</hi> which ſeems to ſignifie <hi>Gaudia Mundi,</hi> the joys of the world, in regard of the Turnaments or other paſtimes which the Lords of <hi>Swaben</hi> have heretofore given their friends there, is entirely Catholique, and an Imperial City ſince the death of <hi>Conradine</hi> who was beheaded at <hi>Naples. Goſtar,</hi> a City of <hi>Hircynia,</hi> was fortified in the year 1207. The Caſtle is called the Imperial Palace, and the Town the Royal City, becauſe the Kings of <hi>Germany</hi> were wont to make their aboad there, and ſome Emperors have honoured it with their reſidence. <hi>Guelnehauſen</hi> after the ſame manner as <hi>Fridberg</hi> hath City and Caſtle, and place in the Aſſemblies, though the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors Palatine uſe their utter moſt endeavour to bring it under their ſubjection.</p>

                  <p>Theſe Cities are not far diſtant from one another: They have the ſame intereſt; and are powerful, <hi>Hambourg</hi> upon the Ocean, and <hi>Lubeck</hi> upon the Balthique Sea, in the entrance of the <hi>Cimbrique Cherſoneſe,</hi> which contains the Dutchies of <hi>Holſtein, Schleſwick, Stormar,</hi> and <hi>Dithmarſh,</hi> with the Countrey of <hi>Jutland.</hi> The City of <hi>Lubeck</hi> was built by <hi>Adolph</hi> Count of <hi>Holſtein</hi> in the time of the Emperor <hi>Conrade</hi> III. and a little after, it was taken by <hi>Henry Leo</hi> Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Saxony,</hi> who found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Biſhoprick there, as I have read over the Gates of the Caſtle of <hi>Eutin,</hi> the place where the Biſhop reſides.

When it began, it was of no great conſequence; but now it is large, fair, and potent by land, and by water too, the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Drave</hi> encreaſing its Trade, and giving it opportunity to put great ſtore of ſhipping to Sea.</p>

This Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty keeps many of the ornaments uſed at the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation of the Emperors, and there is to be ſeen the Royal Crown, about which there is a Mitre enriched with numberleſs Diamonds, Rubies, Emeralds and Pearls; and on the
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:96329:148"/>forepart thereof a Croſs of Diamonds of very great value; the Dalmatique Gown of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magne</hi> embroidered with huge Pearls; the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Cloak ſet all over with Eagles embroide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the border whereof is full of great Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds, Diamonds, Sapphires, and Chryſolites; the Buskins covered with plates of gold; the Gloves embroidered with precious ſtones; the Ball, golden Sceptre, and Sword which the Electors bear in Ceremony. But there is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more ſome jealouſie between the Marquiſſes of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> and this City; the Burgers whereof have the power to impriſon their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to caſt them alive into the river.</p>

                  <p>In the time of <hi>Charlemagne</hi> and ſome of his Succeſſors, the Biſhops and Officers of the Crown, joyntly with the Emperor, decided all Eccleſiaſtical cauſes: The Prelates, Counts, and other perſons of quality were convented at the firſt inſtance before the Imperial Court; the Secular Princes could not be judged but in the Diets where the Emperor preſides. If there were any complaints to be made againſt the adminiſtrations of the Emperors, it was done in the ſame Aſſemblies; and when the matter deſerved it, they might depoſe them, but only with the general conſent of all thoſe that had right to ſit there. So it happened to <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonaire</hi> in the year 838. to <hi>Charles</hi> the Groſſe, 887. and ſome ages after, to <hi>Henry</hi> IV. <hi>Otho</hi> IV. and <hi>Frederick</hi> II.</p>

                  <p>Things here below do never continue in
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:96329:153"/>the ſame ſtate; and the Electors being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to a very great power, aſſumed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves alone the authority of Electing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Emperors, though in the beginning it were not ſo. But all dignities run in the ſame ſtrain: Popes heretofore acknowledged they held their greatneſs of the liberality of <hi>Pepin</hi> and <hi>Charlemagne;</hi> yet a little after the death of the latter they lifted up their hornes; <hi>Gregory</hi> IV. would have excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonaire; Nicholas</hi> I. would have done as much to the Emperor <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharius,</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> to <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald; and they had done it, if they had not found the Clergy and People reſolved to oppoſe their unjuſt proceedings. But in proceſs of time <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. ſurpaſſed all his Predeceſſors in reſolution, and finding a good game put into his hands by the ill will of the Emperors Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects towards their Soverain, he excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Henry</hi> IV. and afterwards by the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption <hi>Henry</hi> V. <hi>Frederick</hi> I. <hi>Philip, Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> II. and <hi>Lewis</hi> V. were excommunicated by the Popes.</p>

                  <p>Law-ſhits growing numerous in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the malice of men, the Court of the Empire was alwayes full of Clients: For which cauſe <hi>Maximilian</hi> I. having compaſſion on them, and deſiring to ſpare both their labour and money, ſetled a ſedentary Parliament at <hi>Worms</hi> or at <hi>Francfort</hi> in the year 1495. which was ſoon after removed to <hi>Spire,</hi> and cannot be withdrawn from thence but by the conſent of all the Eſtates, except in time of Plague or War. The Aſſeſſors were but 16. at the firſt, but the number of them hath been encreaſed to 50, who are nominated by the Head and the principal Members of the Empire. The Emperor names the Judge and four of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Officers. The Judge ought to be a Prince or Count, and well skilled in the Civil and Municipal Laws. Every Elector names one Aſſeſſor, and all thereſt are preferred to that employment by the Circles. All theſe perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages ought to be Gentlemen or Doctors; and as they that name them are Catholiques or proteſtants, ſo are the Aſſeſſors of different Religions, and judge of all caſes that are in the power of the Emperor.</p>

                  <p>I find in Hiſtory, that many Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of great importance, wherein Princes were the parties, have been judged by the Emperors, without taking the advice of that Parliament, nay, without ſummoning the parties to the Diets.</p>

                  <p>The firſt of a Family that gets upon the Throne, cannot have ſo little authority, but he eſteems it great; and when Princes of the ſame Houſe bear the Sceptre for a long time together, the greateſt authority ſeems but little to them. From hence it comes to paſs that the preſent Emperors do no more take or expect the conſent of the Eſtates when they have a mind to act or determine againſt the Princes. <hi>Charles</hi> V. did alone proſcribe and by his own authority condemn <hi>Iohn Frederick</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> Landgrave of <hi>Heſſe.</hi> The ſame Emperor did alone decide the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie between the ſame Landgrave and the Count of <hi>Naſſau.

                  <p>Their Principalities are ſubject to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Emperors, and their perſons and Dignities did heretofore acknowledge none but the Pope, but now it is otherwiſe: For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſince the time of <hi>Frederick</hi> II. till the laſt age no Emperor durſt undertake to depoſe a Biſhop, and many Popes have attempted it, and brought it to paſs with eaſe; yet <hi>Charles</hi> V. and his Succeſſors ſeem to have reſumed their power. When that incomparable Prince had proſcribed <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hildeſheim,</hi> the Pope <hi>Paul</hi> III. expreſt his diſpleaſure by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting againſt it; but it was anſwered, that it belonged neither to him nor the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> to judge of the validity or invalidity of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Edict or Proclamation called the <hi>Ban,</hi> and that the Emperor did not care a ſtraw for the ſentence which the Pope had given for the re-eſtabliſhment of the foreſaid Biſhop.

                  <p>The goods of Prieſts ought to contribute ſomething to the neceſſities of the Empire. The perſons of Monks are immediately ſubject to their Priors or Guardians, they to the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials, the Provincials to the General of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and he to the Pope.

                  <p>All well-governed States have their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, wherein they reſolve matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.

                  <p>When the Electors meet together to chooſe a King of the Romans, their Aſſembly is called <hi>The day of Election,</hi> and then the King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> is not preſent there: And when they meet upon other affairs, that King is not called then neither, though it be ſo ordained by the Golden Bull; becauſe the Electors ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Emperor for the moſt part had the Crown of <hi>Bohemia</hi> in his poſſeſſion, they thought it fit to exclude him from thoſe meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and have done ſo by the Capitulations drawn up and made with the late Emperors. Theſe Aſſemblies are called <hi>Churfurſen Tag,</hi> that is, Days of the Electors. The Aſſemblies of <hi>Deputation</hi> are held at <hi>Francfort,</hi> to diſpatch that which could not be reſolved in the Diets.

                  <p>As to the place where the Diets ought to be held, it is to be noted, that according to <hi>Goldaſt, Conſtantine</hi> II. ordained that they ſhould be held every year and perpetually at <hi>Arles; Charlemagne</hi> having tranſlated the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire into <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> would have them at <hi>Mentz;</hi> and <hi>Frederick</hi> II. preferred <hi>Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort</hi> upon the <hi>Meyn</hi> before that place. The Golden Bull decrees, that the firſt Diet after the Election of the Emperor ſhall be held at <hi>Nuremberg;</hi> that none ſhall ever be called
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:96329:157"/>without the bounds of <hi>Germany,</hi> and that it be always in a convenient place. The Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Charles</hi> V. explains and limits that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, ſaying it ought not to be either high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then <hi>Augsbourg,</hi> or lower then <hi>Collen.</hi> And that being obſerved, all other circumſtances are left to the Emperor, who uſually pitches upon an Imperial City, where he may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly received and entertained.</p>

                  <p>That Article was inſerted into the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation with <hi>Charles</hi> V. becauſe he had many Principalities out of the Empire, and they were affraid he might have a mind to convocate the Diets in ſome place out of <hi>Germany.</hi> It ſeems juſt however that a place be choſen where thoſe that are called thither may not be very ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated.

                  <p>All the Eſtates of the Empire whom we have formerly mentioned are by the Emperor called to the Diets. It is only to be obſerved, that he calls the Eccleſiaſtical Princes thither after they are once elected, though before they have their Bulls from the Pope; that in place of Princes under age, he calls their Guardians who adminiſter their Eſtates; and that Princes actually Governing are called thither, though they have not yet received Inveſtiture for what they hold in Fee of the Empire.

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:96329:157"/>Lorraine, Brunſwick, Holſtein, Heſſe, Wirtemberg, Baden,</hi> and <hi>Montbeliard,</hi> the Emperor calls none but thoſe that are in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Government; and in places where the Principalities are divided into equal ſhares, he calls all that have priviledge to ſit in Diets, as for example, the Dukes of <hi>Weimar, Altem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg,</hi> and <hi>Gotta,</hi> who have all voices for their particular Principalities; But if all the divided Eſtates of Princes have but one voice, as the Principality of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> all the Lords together appoint one Deputy. The Emperor doth alſo call thither ſome perſons that have not right of Seſſion; as Count <hi>Papenheim,</hi> who is always preſent there to execute the Office of Vice-Marſhal: And <hi>Charles</hi> V. cauſed Doctor <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> to be at the Diet of <hi>Wormes</hi> in the year 1521.

                  <p>The Office of Vice-Marſhal is, 1. To chooſe Lodgings, mark them, and ſet them out for the Princes the moſt commodiouſly that poſſibly may be; 2. To take care that all things neceſſary for the Aſſembly be brought thither, and diſtributed at a juſt price, weight, and meaſure; 3. To ſurvey the Hall or room where the Aſſembly is to be held, and to ſee it
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:96329:158"/>be adorned and fitted ſuitable to the Dignity of the perſons that are to aſſiſt there; 4. To have a ſpecial eye and regard to the publick ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; 5. To ſignifie unto the Princes and other Eſtates the day and hour when they are to be preſent at the propounding of affairs, and at debates and conſultations, where he alſo ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Being entred thereinto, the Emperor ſeats himſelf on a Throne raiſed upon a ſcaffold covered with rich Tapiſtry: The Electors ſit a degree lower in this order; the Archbiſhop of <hi>Mentz,</hi> followed by him of <hi>Collen,</hi> and he by the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> take place on the

                  <p>When every one hath taken his place one of the Emperors Counſellors, or a Prince, on whom that charge is impoſed, riſes up, ſalutes the Company, and in an excellent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe gives thanks to all the Aſſembly, for that in compliance with the Emperors order all thoſe Princes and Lords have freely and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully reſorted to that place.

That being done, a Secretary reads the Propoſition; which uſually contains no more then the points which the Emperor touched in his ſummons of calling the Eſtates together. After that is read, the Electors, Princes, and Ambaſſadors riſe up, and having conferred together a very little while, one of the company anſwers the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror in the name of all the reſt, that by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition even now made unto them they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the importance of the affairs which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged his Majeſty to call the Aſſembly together; that they know he hath alwayes had, and ſtill hath a very particular care of the publick good; for which they moſt humbly thank him, aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him they will do all that lyes in their power for the advantage of the State; and to the end they may more maturely deliberate, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech his Majeſty to cauſe a Copy of the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to be delivered to them, and to take their perſons and fortunes under the ſhadow of his protection. The Emperor having heard that diſcourſe, gives command that the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition be communicated to them all, exhorts them to give their advice upon every point, and promiſes them his favour and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

                  <p>The Eſtates of the Empire having had ſome time to conſult among themſelves, the Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> ſends a note to him of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and he
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:96329:161"/>to the Vice-Marſhal of the Empire, requiring him to give advertiſement unto all whom it may concern to repair the next day unto the place appointed at ſuch an hour in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon: Which order the Vice-Marſhal obeys. The Eſtates having received ſuch notice, meet together every one in their own Claſſe, whereof there are three: The firſt is that of the Electors; the ſecond, that of the Princes as well Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical as Secular, of the Abbots, Counts, and Barons; the third, of the Imperial or Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Cities. The Electors being met together, he of <hi>Mentz</hi> ſits at the upper end, thoſe of <hi>Trier</hi> and <hi>Collen</hi> on his right and left hand by turns; they of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes on the right, and the <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Palatine</hi> alwayes on the left hand.</p>

                  <p>The Golden Bull aſſigns a certain place to each Elector; but it is not ſo with the other Lords, no nor with the Imperial Cities, which have alwayes ſome proteſtation to make againſt the wrong they pretend to be done them. The ſecond Claſſe is diſtinguiſht into two Benches: Upon the firſt ſit the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, and Abbeſſes, the Grand Maſter of the Teutonique Order, the Archdukes, and the Duke of <hi>Burgundy;</hi> upon the ſecond are placed all the Secular Princes, Counts, and
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:96329:161"/>Barons, that have right to ſit in thoſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. As to thoſe of the firſt Bench; the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> ſeldom ſends thither; the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> take then turns of precedence with the Archbiſhop of <hi>Saltzbourg,</hi> who is now the only man left of that quality that ſits in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets; and the Grand Maſter of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order precedes all the Biſhops: And further then this, I do not know what Order the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and the Abbots obſerve in their Seſſion. As to the Secular Princes, the younger ſons of the Electoral Houſes precede the other Princes, whoſe manner of ſitting hath been ſufficiently declared already. The third Claſſe is that of the Cities, which are alſo diſtinguiſht into two Branches; the Deputy of <hi>Collen</hi> holds the firſt rank amongſt the Cities of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and he of <hi>Rutisbon</hi> amongſt thoſe of <hi>Swaben.</hi>

                  <p>In the firſt Claſſe the Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> takes the voices, proceeding after this manner: He firſt asks the Elector of <hi>Trier</hi> his opinion, and then him of <hi>Collen,</hi> in the third place of the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> then of <hi>Saxony,</hi> after of <hi>Brandenbourg,</hi> and laſtly, of the Count Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine. After all which, the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> asks him of <hi>Mentz</hi> his ſuffrage; which is of great importance, becauſe being the laſt, he

I ſay there are ſome Princes that have more then one voice, becauſe it happens that one Prince hath more then one Principality, and then he hath as many voices as Immediate Lordſhips to which that right is annext. For example, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> hath a voice for <hi>Bremen,</hi> for <hi>Verden,</hi> and for <hi>Pomerania</hi> reſpectively; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Elector of <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> for the ſame <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and for the Principalities of <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berstad</hi> and <hi>Minden.</hi> If there were but one Duke of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> he would have four voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and one Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> would have above five or ſix.</p>

                  <p>We have ſeen before, that the third Claſſe is diſtinguiſht into two Benches: The firſt contains all the Free Cities of the <hi>Rhine, Alſatia, Landfortey, Haguenau, Wetteravis,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:96329:162"/>Baxony,</hi> and <hi>Thuringia;</hi> the other contains all the other Free Cities of <hi>Germany.</hi> The City wherein the general Aſſembly is held, hath the <hi>Directory,</hi> that is, the Deputy of that City is ſeated near a Table with ſome Senators, and a Regiſter or Clerk of each Bench, and gathers the voices, asking the opinion firſt of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty of <hi>Collen,</hi> then of him of <hi>Ratisbon;</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he returns to the Bench of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and ſo to that of <hi>Swaben,</hi> continuing in that manner till he hath done. By which it is eaſily ſeen, that there is not the meaneſt City, but hath a voice amongſt the Cities, if it have right to ſit amongſt them; but they have but two voices for them all together in the Body of the Empire repreſented compendiouſly in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets.</p>

                  <p>The matters handled in the Diets are all very important, regarding Religion or the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Government; as may be ſeen in the <hi>Receſſe</hi> of the Empire, which contains the reſolutions taken in the general Aſſemblies, and the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances therein made. Here you are to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that in the Aſſemblies plurality of voices is uſually followed in all ſorts of buſineſs; but becauſe the Catholiques taken in groſſe are in greater number and have more voices then the Proteſtants, it hath been thought neceſſary for the peace of the Empire, to take an equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:96329:163"/>of perſons, when they would decide any thing in matter of Religion, and where ſcruple of Conſcience might ſtrain too hard upon Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.

                  <p>The Concluſion of the Diets is taken as followeth: The Electors having pitched upon a Concluſion amongſt them, ſend it to the Colledge of the Princes, who approve or reject it, and that either in whole or in part, and ſend back their opinion to the ſaid Electors. Upon this opinion of the Princes the Electors delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate again, and return their deliberation to the Princes, deſiring them to weigh their reaſons: if they reſt ſatisfied therewith, the buſineſs is done; but if they perſiſt in a contrary opinion, an Appeal is made to the Deputies of the Cities, who ſometimes adhere to the opinion of the Electors, and ſometimes to that of the Princes; and when they alſo diſſent from both the other Claſſes (as oftentimes they do) they propoſe new Concluſions, to which the Electors and the Princes make anſwer, endeavouring to draw them unto their opinion. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarieties are very often longer then were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:96329:163"/>and then the Emperor exhorts them all to agree, and in all things to prefer the publick before their own private Intereſt. Such exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation doth oftentimes prevail ſo far, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one abates a little of his opinion, and comes to an agreement in the whole or in part; and when they conceive that things are brought to as good terms as they can expect, they ſend them to his Majeſty for his approbation. From this difficulty of bringing perſons to be of one mind, whoſe intereſts and deſires are ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, proceeds that ordinary ſaying, That one Diet is the mother of another, and from thence alſo come thoſe Aſſemblies of <hi>Deputation</hi> which we have briefly touched before.</p>

                  <p>I am well ſatisfied in this point, but your preceding diſcourſe having informed me, that opinions in the Diets are oftentimes ſtiffely and obſtinately held on both ſides, hath left me in a doubt which obligeth me to ask you, whether in caſe the Eſtates cannot agree, the Emperor ſhould have the power to reſolve matters, and decide the controverted difficulties according to his own will.</p>

                  <p>When the Aſſembly is come to an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Head hath prevailed upon the Members, or the Members brought the Head to conſent unto their opinion, the reſolutions are ſet down in writing, and ſigned before they be publiſhed. Heretofore the Emperor alone ſigned them, or in his abſence the King of the Romans; afterwards there was added thereunto the Sign and Seal of two Electors, two Princes, one Abbot, one Count, and the Deputy of the City where the Aſſembly was held. At this time the ſigning is as followeth: The <hi>Receſſe,</hi> that is to ſay, the Act being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in parchment, the Emperors Seal is applied below upon two ſmall ſilken cords joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which are then parted in two again to the right ſide and to the left; upon the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide cord there is impreſſed the Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> his Seal, if he be preſent, or in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence one of the Eccleſiaſtical Electors; below that, the Seal of the firſt Eccleſiaſtical Prince there preſent, and of one of the Prelates in the third place: On the left ſide of the Imperial Seal the firſt Secular Elector there preſent puts his, juſt over againſt that of the Elector of <hi>Mentz;</hi> then the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> or in his
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:96329:165"/>abſence the moſt eminent Secular Prince then preſent; and in the third place a Count of <hi>Wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teravia</hi> or of <hi>Swaben</hi> by turns: Laſtly, the two cords are cloſed again, and faſtned with the Seal of the City where the Aſſembly is kept. When that is done, the Elector of <hi>Mentz</hi> reads it openly, and then all the Princes and Lords wait upon the Emperor to his Lodging.</p>

                     <hi>Ferdinand</hi> III. Son to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:96329:166"/>piety, he was choſen King of the Romans at <hi>Ratisbon</hi> in the year 1636. and on the 9. of <hi>July</hi> 1637. when his Father dyed, he took the Reins of the Empire into his hand, and was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually Emperor, though his Enemies refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give him the title, till the beginning of the Treaty of Peace which was concluded at <hi>Munſter</hi> the 24. of <hi>October</hi> 1648.

                  <p>The deceaſe of that pious Prince was the innocent cauſe of the diſpute which is at this day between the Electors of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, the firſt pretending that the Vicarſhip of the Empire is inſeparably annext to his Elector<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the other, to the poſſeſſion of the Lower Palatinate: And I remember I have heard you ſay, that <hi>Frederick</hi> V.

I do not know whether it be, that our nature is always longing for new things, or that God uſually puniſhes our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, even in this life: But ſo it was, that the Head and principal Members of the Empire en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a miſunderſtanding and diſtruſt of one another; while the firſt endeavouring to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large his authority, found himſelf in danger to loſe it; and the latter deſiring to preſerve their priviledges, filled their ſtates with miſery, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and infinite mortalities.</p>

                  <p>It is not impoſſible but that zeal might have carried the pious diſpoſition of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> II. upon ſome enterprize which might claſh with that liberty of Religion which was tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Edicts of his Predeceſſors; and if you adde thereunto, with what eaſe he diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated the dreadful Forces which <hi>Frederick</hi> V. Elector Palatine, <hi>Bethlehem Gabor,</hi> and his other Confederates had drawn together, you will make no further doubt, but that his good ſucceſs inflamed and heightned that zeal of his; and that the ſame great Prince, believing his victories to be viſible evidences that God called him to humble and bring down every thing that did not acknowledge the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> would have endeavoured to force conſciences,

                  <p>When the Forces of two Enemies are equal, if piety employ them to preſerve liberty of Conſcience, or vain-glory to get more Crowns, they produce ſad and diſmal effects, and bring deſtruction upon many Provinces.

                     <pb n="321" facs="tcp:96329:169"/>laid the foundations of a longer and bloodier War: Which obliged the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> and ſome other Princes to change Intereſt, and endeavour to keep up the greatneſs of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> So the Emperor being ſupported by the Catholique King, ſome Electors and other Potentates of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Swedes</hi> aſſiſted by the Forces of <hi>France, Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and ſome Proteſtant Princes; the match became ſo equal, that the War held on, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with gain, ſometimes with loſs, from the year 1630. till 1648.</p>

                  <p>The third was at <hi>Hamelen, July</hi> 28. 1663. between the <hi>Swedes, Heſſians,</hi> and <hi>Lune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgers,</hi> commanded by <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Lune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> General of the Circle of Lower <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the Imperialiſts under the conduct of the Counts of <hi>Merode</hi> and <hi>Grandsfeld;</hi> where the latter were worſted.

                     <hi>Germany,</hi> hath not brought her even to her grave. Yet this is not all; ſhe hath loſt more valiant perſons in the Fights which I am going to relate, then in the pitcht Battels. The firſt was that of the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who ſet upon the Imperial Army entrenched and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Walleſtein</hi> at <hi>Furts</hi> upon the Old Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 24. 1632. and was forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat with very great loſs, giving a remarkable example, that Great men commit great errors, and that the courage of the Lion doth rarely cohabit with the ſubtilty of the Fox; becauſe in ſome, that heat of the heart which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to make a man undaunted, diſſipates and quickens the coldneſs of the brain; in others, that predominant temper of the brain commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates ſuch a faint and languiſhing quality to the heart as obſtructs and fetters its activity. The ſecond was fought by the Electors of <hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> (when they were confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated with the <hi>Swedes</hi>) againſt the Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, who were worſted near <hi>Lignitz</hi> in <hi>Sileſia May</hi> 3. 1634. The third was that of <hi>Rheim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld,</hi> where <hi>Bernard</hi> Duke of <hi>Weymar</hi> beat the Duke of <hi>Savelli</hi> and <hi>John de Werdt,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Imperial and <hi>Bavarian</hi> Troops, in ſeveral encounters from the 18. till the 21. of <hi>February,</hi> 1638. The fourth was given at <hi>Wittenvoyer</hi> in <hi>Briſgou,</hi> where the ſame Duke of <hi>Saxon-Weymar</hi> did again beat the Imperialiſts and Bavarians commanded by the Count of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:96329:172"/>
                     <hi>Gotzen</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savelli, July</hi> 30. 1638. Then that Prince crowned all his former actions, when he ſent ſome Generals priſoners to <hi>Paris,</hi> and obliged all <hi>Europe</hi> to confeſs, that few things were impoſſible for him to do, ſince, notwithſtanding all the power of his Enemies uſed to the contrary, he forced the Virgin City of <hi>Briſac</hi> to ſubmit her ſelf unto his will.</p>

                  <p>I never ſaid he was invincible; but I dare confidently affirm, that he was never beaten for want of courage or conduct: And <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vezzi</hi> himſelf acknowledging that he won more then he loſt, doth alſo confeſs, that the deſign which he had to keep in a Body by himſelf, and to exchange the places he held in <hi>Burgundy</hi> for thoſe of <hi>Colmar, Seleſtadt</hi> and <hi>Benfeld,</hi> thereby to make himſelf maſter of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> and by the means of that great and wealthy Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to maintain a high reputation as long as the War laſted, and to enter upon a Peace with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, were great thoughts, but nothing diſproportionable to the ſpirit, fortune, and valour of that excellent Prince. The fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:96329:173"/>hapned, <hi>April</hi> 4. 1639. near <hi>Kemnitz</hi> in <hi>Miſnia,</hi> where <hi>Bannier</hi> the <hi>Swedes</hi> General overcame the Imperialiſts and <hi>Saxons</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by General <hi>Salis.</hi> The ſixth was an action of the Archduke <hi>Leopold</hi> and <hi>Picolomini,</hi> more bold then well adviſed, when they ſet upon the <hi>Swedes, French</hi> and <hi>Lunebourgers</hi> in their Trenches at <hi>Wolfenbottel,</hi> and were beaten back with the loſs of their Foot, and the left wing of their Horſe, <hi>June</hi> 19. 1641.

<pb n="329" facs="tcp:96329:173"/>Mareſhall <hi>Guebriant,</hi> being commanded by Count <hi>Ioſias de Rantzau,</hi> was ſurpriſed by the Bavarian Forces under the conduct of <hi>Hatzfeld,</hi> and <hi>Iohn de Werdt</hi> at <hi>Dutlinguen</hi> a little Town in the Dutchy of <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> and nothing was ſaved but a part of the Horſe led by General <hi>Roſe.</hi>

                  <p>That Mareſhal was exceedingly beloved by the German Troops, being a man of ſingular courage and conduct, and ſo careful of them, that in his time they were alwayes very well paid. The tenth would have ſtrucken the very trees with fear and admiration, if they had had any ſenſe, for <hi>Lewis de Bourbon,</hi> then Duke of <hi>Anguyen</hi> and now Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> made five aſſaults upon the Bavarian Army entrenched upon a mountain near <hi>Fribourg</hi> in <hi>Briſgou,</hi> where he ſlew their General <hi>Gaſpar de Mercy</hi> in the yeare 1644. forced the Enemies army to quit their Poſte, and afterwards went to take <hi>Philipſbourg</hi> and ſome other places, though he had loſt very much brave Nobility. The Fleventh made <hi>Merkendal</hi> in <hi>Franconia</hi> to be talked of, where Mareſhal <hi>Turenne</hi> General of the French Forces was ſurpriſed by <hi>Francis de Mercy</hi> General of the Bavarians, <hi>November</hi>
                     <pb n="330" facs="tcp:96329:174"/>14. 1645. The loſs nevertheleſs was not ſo great as ſome Writers would perſwade us, if that be true which I have been told upon the place. The Twelfth was fought by the French and Heſſian armies againſt the Bavarian, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the loſs was almoſt equal; but <hi>Francis</hi> Baron <hi>de Mercy</hi> was ſlain there, and the Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guyen,</hi> Mareſhal <hi>Turenne,</hi> and <hi>Geis</hi> remained maſters of the Field, and had the ſpoil of the dead, <hi>May.</hi> 5. 1646.</p>

                  <p>It ſeemes there is a kind of fatality in things of this world: here were two brethren, both Generals of the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> and both ſlain in fight by the Duke of <hi>Anguyen.</hi> It is further remarkable, that the <hi>French</hi> got few or no victories, but they coſt them very much blood.</p>

                  <p>Ordinarily the <hi>French</hi> would carry all by main force, and think thoſe victories but little honourable that are gotten by ſurprize: Nevertheleſs the Generals that are ſparing of their Souldiers lives, ahve alwayes been, and are ſtill more eſteemed, then they that part with them at ſo cheap a rate. The thirteenth Fight was a ſudden unforeſeen engagement, wherein the Armies of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>France</hi> commanded by the Mareſhals <hi>Charles Guſtavus Wrangel,</hi> &amp; <hi>Henry de la Tour</hi> Prince of <hi>Turenne,</hi> both equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolute and prudent, having accidentally fallen upon the Imperial and Bavarian Forces under the conduct of <hi>Melander</hi> (otherwiſe
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:96329:174"/>called the Count of <hi>Holt zapfel</hi> and <hi>Gronsfeld</hi>) forced them off their ground, and purſued them about two Leagues with great effuſion of blood, which yet had been far greater, if <hi>

But that was not the only place where Duke <hi>Frederick</hi> of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> made his courage to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:96329:175"/>of.

                  <p>I know the moſt Chriſtian King obliged himſelf to pay the Archduke of <hi>Inſpruck</hi> three millions of Livres, in caſe he could prevail with the Catholique King to quit the pretenſions he had or might have upon <hi>Alſatia.</hi> But had the Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi> and its Confederates many Troops and places in <hi>Germany,</hi> when the Peace was made?</p>

                  <p>The Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi> had at that time five Regiments of Swediſh and Finland Horſe, four and forty of German Horſe, and five of Dragons, which reckoned with ſome Troops that were in Garriſon, amounted all together to 411.

                  <p>By what you ſaid laſt, I perceive <hi>Germany</hi> made War upon <hi>Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Swedes</hi> made uſe of us to overcome our ſelves: Let us ſee whether the French did not ſo too.</p>

                  <p>We are blamed for loving money too much, and the honour of our Nation too little. Now it is certain, that although the <hi>Swedes</hi> have always had Commanders worthy of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and that after their King, <hi>Guſtavus Horn, John Bannier, Leonard Torſtenſon, Charles Guſtavus Wrangel, Wittemberg,</hi> and ſome others have equalled or ſurpaſſed the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Heroes, ſignalizing their valour in our late Wars; yet they had gone out of the Empire with as much ſhame, and as well beaten as the <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Tranſylvanians,</hi> if they had not had Religion for a pretenſe, our bodies for a buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and our courages for the inſtruments of their glory. The ſame thing may be ſaid of the French: They have had Generals of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion who have always performed the duty of wiſe Captains and valiant Souldiers, and have no leſs deſerved the name of Gallant men, though they have fought with leſs ſucceſs then the <hi>Swedes;</hi> but as to the reſt, the French Troops were oftentimes the leaſt part of their Army. The French that have commanded in <hi>Germany,</hi> are the Mareſhals of <hi>La Force, Guebriant,</hi> and <hi>Grammont,</hi> the Cardinal <hi>de la Valette,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Longueville</hi> and <hi>Anguyen,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Turenne,</hi> who had under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,

                  <p>That Bull is the Diamond Nail which holds together theſe remainders of the Empire, and keeps them from diſſolution, by the wholeſome Ordinances which it contains,
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:96329:179"/>touching the time, the place, and the perſons which ought to concur to the Election of the Emperor; the number, immunities, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminences of the Electors; the integrity, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and probity which they ought to uſe in chooſing the firſt Prince of Chriſtendom; the order they ought to keep in their Aſſemblies, as well while they accompany the Emperor, as in their ſeats and places; and to cut off all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of diſpute between the Princes of the Electoral Houſes, the Emperor by that Edict ſets down and preſcribes the order they are to obſerve in their ſucceſſions, who ought to be Tutor and Guardian of their ſons during their Minority, and at what age they are to come out of Wardſhip. Now becauſe Elective Eſtates have no ſymptom more dangerous, then while they lie under an <hi>Interregnum,</hi> the Bull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides a remedy for that inconvenience, ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Electors Palatine and of <hi>Saxony</hi> ſhall be his Majeſties perpetual Vicars, and ſhall have the ſame power after his death, or in his abſence, that the Emperor had while he was living and preſent.

From hence it was, that this perpetual and irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Edict, containing the fundamental Laws of the Empire, ought to be ſealed with his Majeſties great ſeal, and not upon wax, lead, or ſilver, but upon gold, to ſhow that as that metal is incorruptible, &amp; the moſt excellent of all; ſo the matters contained in that Bull, being the principal Laws of the Empire, ſhould be preſerved there without alteration.</p>

                  <p>The Bull which hangs at the Parchment book which we laſt mentioned, is a great round ſeal of pure gold, faſtened unto ſmall cords of yellow and red ſilk, on one ſide whereof there is the Portraiture of the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> IV. ſeated upon his Throne, with the Crown on his head, the Sceptre in one hand, and the Ball in the other, having at his right hand the Imperial Arms, and thoſe of <hi>Bohemia</hi> at his left, with this Inſcription round about
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:96329:181"/>the Bull, <hi>Carolus quartus, Divinâ favente cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentiâ, Romanorum Imperator, ſemper Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus, &amp; Bohemiae Rex.</hi> On the other ſide of the Bull there is a Caſtle with two Towers, at the bottom and middle whereof there is ſeen a Gate with theſe words, <hi>Aurea Roma,</hi> and theſe in the Circumference, <hi>Roma caput mundi, regit Orbis froena rotundi.</hi>

                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>Thoſe Laws are fortified with a Seal that declares their importance; and I am confident the Emperor will derogate as little from them as he can.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>Uſually Laws cannot be abrogated but by thoſe that made them, and for that reaſon I believe, though the Emperor ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to annul the <hi>Golden Bull,</hi> he would not be permitted ſo to do, becauſe it was publiſhed by the advice, and with the conſent of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors, and many other Princes and Eſtates of the Empire, who are to concur to its abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. But the Bull is ſo advantagious to the Electors, that they have no reaſon to deſire the ſuppreſſion of it, nor ſo much as give way that any thing in it ſhould be changed or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>P.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not think the Laws contained in the <hi>Golden Bull</hi> ſhould be totally aboliſhed: yet on the other ſide I do not doubt but ſomething of them may be changed, if the neceſſity of the Empire require it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>G.</speaker>
                  <p>It is certain that thoſe Laws will never
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:96329:181"/>be wholly abrogated, unleſs the face of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire be changed by becoming Hereditary; in which caſe they would all fall of themſelves. As to particularities, it is as certain that ſomething in thoſe Laws may be changed, ſince the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators have often derogated from them, and even in a matter of great importance, the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenary number of the Electors having been altered into another leſs convenient by the laſt Treaty of Peace: Beſides, we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſeen, that although the Election of the King of the Romans ought to be made at <hi>Francfort</hi> by vertue of that Bull, yet <hi>Ferdinand</hi> I. received that honour at <hi>Wormes,</hi> and other Emperors ſince at other Cities. That Bull doth alſo ordain, that all the Electors ſhould aſſiſt at the Maſs of the Holy Ghoſt, before they begin the Act of the Election; and yet the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Electors are not obliged to be at Church while the Ceremony of the Maſs laſts. From whence it may be concluded, that ſome of the Laws of the <hi>Golden Bull</hi> may be altered and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with. But I believe I have entertained you long enough upon things that concern the Empire; and therefore I ſhall proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but make an end of this Treatiſe, praying the Almighty that by his grace he would ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you to learn from hence how to ſerve your Country well, &amp; me to give you as good an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the other principal parts of Europe as I have done of <hi>Germany.</hi>
